Ansbacher Finance Group Ltd. Ref: Anb/Ift/0769 Rc: 2354523 Delivery of Consignment Cargo. Hello, My name is Micheal Dodson, i urgently need your personal assistant concerning a lost CONSIGNMENT for the past seven days on delivery of some CONSIGNMENTS CARGO with some FG DIPLOMATS. Actually one of the payment they were ask to deliver to one (Mrs. Vicky Stuart ) cannot be transacted due to the beneficiary cannot be reached; the consignment is worth of $3.2MILLION U.S DOLLAS. As a DELEGATE APPOINTEE on assignment, i have discussed with the DIPLOMATS that has the sole responsibility delivery of this particular lost consignment that i have someone we can pay off the funds to avoid taken risk going around countries with the lost consignment cargo voucher. I'm requesting your partnership and honest assistant to pay off this consignment to you as the beneficiary, if this will interest you kindly contact me as soon as possible to discuss regarding the delivery of the Consignment to you before the cargo departure at terminal. You are entitled 25% from the said funds upon mutual agreement immediately the transaction is been handled sucessfully. This is an opportunity for you so don't loose it. There will be a diplomatic immunity that will warrant the airport authority not to search their cargo based on diplomatic immunity, unless reverse is the case that the beneficiary shows up then the DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY is automatically revoked and it will be opened. This is the reason why is always preferable and better that DIPLOMATS deliver consignment by themselves to the designated address or office. Please contact me with an immediate answer and i will get back to you with more details. My Private E-mail: stflc3001@gmail.com Yours Sincerely	TEST2misc	0.27293380341779244

Dearest With all sincerity and humility, it is with deep pains i write you this message of wishful assistance to my predicament.You might have heard or read about the ongoing civil war raged in my country, Libya. For over eight months bloody civil war, which I have never wittiness in my life time, except the ones I heard, ready or watched in the video cassette, the growing pains and deaths that ruling government troops and those of her current rivals and erstwhile allies have brought to the citizens of Libya, which recently laid to the sanction against Libya government by the United Nation (UN) it’s alies. The war has brought an untold hardship of large magnitude to many families in Libya including mine. In fact, right now I am the only surviving daughter of my father,who is one of the top officials during the regime of the dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi,s 42 years in power,but because of Gaddafi,s refusal to listen to the voice of masses which my father advices him, they got crash and my father decamped from his cabinet, then his so-called loyalist invaded our house and looted every thing, killed my father with three of my elder brothers in the scene, This, in fact, made my family a target of his loyalist’s persecution and attack, leading to the deaths of entire members of my family,i managed to escape from Mali to Burkina-Faso neighbouring country where my mother comes from, then am now living here as a refugee. However, we were very rich until the war broke out and changed my fortune for the worst. While going through my father’s business files, I stumbled on a letter showing the deposit of a vault with a security company by my late father before the uprising started in February 2011. I remember my father telling me one night to take care of it as the vault contains the sum of US$ 10 million of Dollar bills and precious gold of inestimable value that should be used to take care of the family and his business in case any thing bad happens to him during this war against their regime. Recently, I managed to contact the security company and they confirmed having such vault in their strong room. They however requested me to come forward to claim the vault as soon as possible upon payment of certain security fees which I do not have now because of my present predicament as a refugee. I have actually notified them that I will soon make arrangements to file a claim to that effect. You may be pleased to hear that I am currently processing necessary UN travel papers that can enable me to move out of Republic of Burkin-Faso to any choice country. Being financially and circumstantially constrained, I now seek your kind assistance in securing this vault on my behalf for safekeeping and high yield investments pending when I am able to secure my travel papers. Honestly, I am forced to seek external assistance because of my situation and have the confidence that you will not capitalize on my predicament to seize the money or cheat me out of the treasure after the conclusion of the business. My trust in you is based on my belief in God. Meanwhile i will not forget to explain myself to you,I am Miss Aicha Boudouh Ahmed 22yrs a student of University of Misrata,Libya. Please, respond to me urgently to confirm if you are in position to assist me or not so we can agree on terms and conditions of your assistance. If for any reason you are not interested, kindly please put me in your daily prayers for god’s continued protection and blessing in this regard. I sincerely thank you and look forward to reading from you urgently. Yours in need Miss Aicha Boudouh Ahmed	TEST4	refugees	0.9453408773583913
