  How are you with your family? Well I saw your email as a
possible pet lover. I am looking for somebody to adopt my Yorkie
puppies. The major reason I am giving them out for adoption is that I
don't have much time to take good care of them. I was hoping to breed
them, hence I have decided to give them out for adoption. I love them
so much and I have actually put in so much to make them happy. I would
need a pet lover with a good heart that would be able to afford
vet-visits and dedications.
They are AKC registered & CKC,Teacup. Home Raised, Vaccines & health
Guarantee, with complete papers and up to date on all shots/worming.
They are already potty trained with excellent temperament and also
very good with children and other animals. If you are interested and
willing to take good care of them! Please feel free to contact me at
suemoodull@gmail.com and i will email you their picture.

Please Email to: suemoodull@gmail.com

Best regards'
