Dear beloved brother in Christ,
On behalf of the entire members of our church, the choirs and Mary league team, we are pleading for some financial aid.
The church of GOD was turned up side down on the 25th day of December 2011, we experienced a terrible bomb blast around our church, almost after the service; leaving up to 100 people dead. Some part of our building collapsed in the northern part of Nigeria in NigerState. The explosion was suspected to have been caused by an Islamic Group called Boko Haram. Since this period of four days, our orphanage section is in dismay. I have experienced a horrible situation coupled with casualties. Up till now the government has not assisted us financially. I will not say that this has taken the church backwards; rather it will widen our church and our faith by the Grace of God.
We are pleading in the name of our LORD JESUS CHRIST to fellow Christian philanthropists for help to enable us do some repairs, most importantly, we are still having some wounded members at saint Joseph hospital based on this, no amount is too small for the total running cost and renovation provided it is from the bottom of your heart.
Please don't fail to add up your personal name for our prayer warriors will be on, praying for your kind gesture {western union is preferable please}.
God bless you.
