My Dear Friend,

Please I want you to read this letter very carefully and I must apologize for barging this message into your mail box without any formal introduction due to the urgency and confidential of this issue and I know that this message will come to you as a surprise.

Please this is not a joke and I will not like you to joke with it.

I am Mr Dahk Nicolas,a Manager in African Development Bank, (ADB) Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. I Hoped that you will not expose or betray this trust and confident that I am about to establish with you for the mutual benefit of you and I. This fund was deposited in our bank by Mr. Kattan Azmal from Jordan

who died in a plane crash in 2000 Tbm 700 aircraft on 31st July with his wife and the whole crew on board.I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of ($10.5) million USD into your account within 7 working banking days.

This money has been dormant for years in our Bank without claim due to the owner of this fund died along with his entire family and supposed next of kin in an air crash since July 31st 2000.

I want our bank to release this fund to you as the nearest person to our deceased customer while i come over to your country to share this fund with you as soon as you confirm this fund into your account and ask me to come over. I don't want the money to go into our Bank treasure as an abandoned fund.

So this is the reason why i contacted you so that our bank will release
this money to you as the next of kin to the deceased customer.

Please I would like you to keep this proposal as a top secret and delete it if you are not interesting.

As the director of the department, this discovery was brought to my office so as to decide what is to be done. i decided to seek ways through which transfer this money out of the bank and out of the country too. The total initial amount deposited in this account was thirty six million, five hundred thousand dollars (usd 36,500,000.00) but with subsequent withdrawals from the account by the depositor before his death,

the account was audited by my department and we discovered that the remaining balance in the bank account is ten million, five hundred thousand dollars (usd 10, 500.000.00 and with my position as the accounts and audit department director of this bank.

Upon the receipt of your reply and indication of your capability, i will give you full details on how the business will be executed and also note that you will have 50% of the above mentioned sum if you agree to handle this business with me while 50% be for me,

Because i don't want anyone here in our bank to know my involvement until you confirm this fund into your account and ask me to come over for the sharing as I indicated.

I am looking forward to hear from you immediately for further information do not hesitate to call me on this number
