Dear Friend,

          I am DirkJan Martins, A Netherlands national,I was browsing and
I saw your e-mail I decided write you  if your e-mail is real, I
have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. It has defiled all
forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a
few months to live. I am very rich, but was never generous; I
have given most of my assets to my immediate family members.

I have decided to give alms to charity organizations. I cannot do this
myself anymore because of my health. I once asked members of my family to
give some money to charity organizations, they refused and kept the money.
I have a huge cash deposit of Eighteen Million dollars with a finance
House abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch
it to charity organizations. You will take out 20% of these funds for your
assistance.

Please answer these questions.

[1] Full Names:
[2] Contact address:
[3] Direct Telephone -
[4] Date of birth:
[5] Occupation:-

I will like you to acknowledge the receipt of this e-mail as soon as
possible and  treats with absolute confidentiality and sincerity.

Regards,

DirkJan Martins
