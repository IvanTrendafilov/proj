With code of conduct (ATM-212).

Attn, Beneficiary.
Listen  very  carefully...

Enough  is  enough,  I  am  writing  to  remind  you  about  your  package ATM CARD  in  my  office  and  to  alert  you  about  our  weekly  action  concerning  every  old  packages  in  our  offices.  Like  i  told  earlier,  your  package  "ATM  CARD"  have  more  few  days  to  return  back  to  the  Bank  and  you  think  i am  lying  to  you.

Now  we  have  started  retrieving  every  old  packages  in  our  various  offices,  Yesterday  we  returned  about  23  packages  that  have  spent  more  than  enough  years  in  our  office  here  in  New  York,  while  we  shall  also  return  42  packages  today  and  each  one  that  returned  back  will  be  canceled.. 
Be  advised  that  your  own  package ATM / CARD  is  at  risk  because  the  BARCLAYS BANK / WORLD BANK GROUP  have  given  us  the  final  mandate  concerning  your  ATM  CARD  in  our  office..  If  you  do  not  put  any  effort  to  receive  your  Payment ATM CARD  this  week  then  we  shall  stop  the  whole  transaction  and  send  the  ATM  CARD  back  to  the  Bank  because  it  seems  that  you  are  not  serious  about  it.. 

Now  i  want  to  use  this  opportunity  to  clear  your  mind  about  the  hold-up  of  your  payment  ATM CARD.  Like  i  told  you  previously,  before  we  make  any  delivery  both  Local  or  International,  the  beneficiary  have  to  clear  out  his/her  consignment  which  is  to  pay  the  Insurance  fee  of  $220 dollars  to  avoid  wrongly  delivery,  cause  of  embargo,  and  in-case  of  loss  or  damage. 

So  try  to  understand  that  the  only  thing  holding  us  now  to  deliver  your  payment ATM CARD  to  you  is  this  fee  of  $220 dollars  for  the  Insurance Coverage..  I  assured  you  that  after  you  make  this  payment,  your  package ATM CARD  will  be  delivered  to  you  withing  24 hours.

So  kindly  go  to  the  Western Union  now  and  send  this  $220 dollars  for  the  Insurance Coverage  to  this  appropriate  cashier  officer  in-charge  to  receive  the  payment,  then  i  will  deliver  your  package  ATM CARD  the  next  day  to  avoid  returning  back.

See  the  below  details  to  send  the  fee.
