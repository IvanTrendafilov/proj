S'Hi Timothy,\n\n\nWOOOOOWW!!!! I am literally jumping in my chair right now. This is truly amazing. THANK YOU SO MUCH. This is truly unbelievable. I cannot thank you enough.\nPlease allow me to ask a few questions.\nDo I have to pay any administration fees to release my prize. If so, can I pay for this from my winnings?\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings. If so, is there a way for me to avoid them?\n\n\nThanks,\nDaniel\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 04:01:50 2012 <gentclaime@blumail.org> wrote:\n> \n> It has finally come to our notice that you have not claimed your winning price.

The recent presidential election of November, 28th 2010 in Republic of Cote dIvoire which resulted civil war that just ended last few month ago caused a lot of people to be homeless, parentless and many more. I am 19yrs old girl and sincerely wish to inform you that I will like your assistance in investing in your country as to enable me relocate here to continue my education as the only child of my parents; I lost my father during the civil war because he was suspected to have rendered financial assistance to former president and his elites and my mother died when I was only 4years old.

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am very sorry to hear about your loss. Recently, I also lost someone that I cared deeply about, so I can relate to your pain. Whilst there is no cure for the loss of a family member, I believe that time heals all wounds. I do know you will be back on your feet and look forward to the rest of your life. Please be sure I will do my best to help you.\nPlease allow me to ask you a few questions before we proceed further.\nDo you have any brothers or sisters that also need help? If so, can you take care of them when we arrange everything for you?\nWhat do you plan to do with the funds once they are released to you?\n\n\nThank you,\nLeo\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 04:06:38 2012 <marietcisse2011@hotmail.fr> wrote:\n> Compact Headers\n> My sincere greetings to you,\n> \n> Hello Dear ,\n> \n> I am indeed glad to be in contact with you even though this medium of communication (internet) has been grossly abused by some people making it difficult for other once with genuine struggle to correspond and exchange views without skepticism.\n> I got your contact from the internet and that is why I decided to\n> contacted you; hence it is the cheapest way for todays communication.

S'Hello,\n\n\nLet me tell you something amazing.\n\nYesterday, I went sledding down a popular hill in my hometown with my brother and his wife. At the bottom of the hill, there\'s a frozen pond. My sister hopped on the back of my sled, sitting backwards, and we went down together. Due to the extra mass, we started going way faster than I\'d expected, when I noticed we were heading right toward a little kid. I just couldn\'t maneuver out of the way, so I leaned forward and scooped the kid up, holding him up like Simba. Then I realized we were still about to sled into a frozen pond, so I bailed out and held the kid as high over my head as I could. I stood up, set the kid down, and looked around for his parents. When I saw a big dude coming at me, I was like oh hell here we go. Then he got closer and I realized it was of my closest friends, and that the kid I ran into was his son who I babysit regularly. I thought to myself, "No way!" and gave him a big hug. The kid said he thought it was "awesome."\n\nRegards,\nPatrick Turner\n\n\nOn Sat, 11 Feb 2012 01:57:57 +0800 (SGT) <eliz2@singnet.com.sg> wrote:\n> Attention Beneficiary/Winner:\n> \n> Congratulations:You are the beneficiary of\n> 700,00 donated to you by the United Nations\n> (UN).Reply for claims(UNGD-UK) winners\n> selected by the computer random draw from the\n> 12.1 million entries registered in the Grand\n> Donation Program .

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am glad to hear back from you.\n\nLet me tell you a story, perhaps you can help.\n\nWe have this local crazy lady... Everybody called her "Crazy Gina". Apparently at one time she was a normal person and had a family and everything, and then she started doing drugs and kind of lost it.\n\nShe had a garden in her front yard, which sounds normal...

S'Hello,\n\n\nThanks for getting back to me so quickly.\n\nThis reminds of an old story...\n\nAbout 6 years ago or so right around the time WoW came out, I had saved up enough money to buy a new car. I spent some time looking over all of the cars available and I wanted something with a low monthly payment. My neighbor worked at the local Mazda dealer and she had recently bought a new Mazda 6 so I decided to go look there. I decided on a Mazda 3 however since I loved the way it looked both inside and out, it could play mp3 cds in the dealer stereo, and it got good gas mileage (I drove an hour each way to work).\n\nBought the car, waited for them to install the spoiler on the back (not a huge one, the car looked weird without it) and then took it home. After a few days I was so happy with the car. It was great. Then one day everything went bad.\n\nMy buddies were coming over to do some drinking. I hadn\'t been out of the house all day but when he got there we needed to make a booze run. We took my car, got back, my other buddy got there too.\n\n2 bottles of Boone\'s Farm later I was pretty drunk. Around 3:30am there was this explosion. We all looked at each other not knowing what it was. We figured it was a truck going by or something. Then the smoke detector went off. This time I got up, walked around the kitchen and looked down the laundry room hallway where I saw fire coming out from underneath and the sides of the door to my garage. I freaked out immediately, and all I could muster was "guys, we gotta get the hell outta here now!" My one buddy and I ran out of the condo shoeless and jacketless in order to get all of my neighbours out of their condos in case the fire spread. My other friend was smarter and grabbed his jacket and shoes.\n\nI called 112, the cops and the firetrucks came. By this time the entire complex was out it seemed. I came around the garage just in time to see the car explode into a massive fireball. Still shoeless and jacketless, a neighbour I didn\'t even know brought out some shoes and a jacket for my one friend and I.\n\nThe next day I went to look, and the condo was toast. The entire garage and hallway leading inside were completely destroyed. The rest of the place had smoke damage throughout, and there was a puddle of water where my floor used to be. Everything I owned was boxed and taken to a cleaning facility to be detoxed. The company that was hired to rebuild the place did everything in their power to repair my condo with sub-builder\'s grade materials and I had to fight them at every turn. I spent more time at work calling around to get things done than I did working. I literally had nothing for the 8 months I lived with my folks except a leaky air mattress I borrowed from someone, my computer, my clothing, and my GBA.\n\nMazda tried to blame the explosion on my friends and I, and we had to talk to all these lawyers and stuff. It took years to get back all the money from the stuff I lost, and some of my stuff came up missing afterwards.\nHere\'s a picture: http://i.imgur.com/Qo1MK.jpg\n\nThank you,\nPatrick\n\n\nOn Thu, 22 Mar 2012 17:44:29 +0800 <eliz2@singnet.com.sg> wrote:\n> Why are you repeating the email and please erase me from mailing list. \n> Thanks.\n> \n> -----Original Message----- \n> From: Patrick Turner\n> Sent: Thursday, March 22, 2012 5:39 PM\n> To: eliz2@singnet.com.sg\n> Subject: Re: Re:\n> \n> Hello,\n> \n> \n> Let me tell you a story, perhaps you can help.\n> \n> We have this local crazy lady...

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am glad to hear back from you.\n\nLet me tell you a story.\n\nMy fianc\xc3\xa9 and I had talked about getting a pet. Growing up, I had only had cats. As an adult, I am highly allergic to them, so I we decided a dog would be best. I had no idea if I would even like having a dog since I had never even played with one.\n\nI read up on caring for dogs, and was super stoked that our town was going to have a Pet Expo soon. We went to it, hoping to get some info about breeds, adoption, supplies, etc.\nThe Expo turned out to be pretty unhelpful as most of the vendors were selling dog clothes and treats. As we were leaving I noticed that there were a couple of booths on the outskirts of the expo that we missed. As we walked toward them, I saw that one had a couple of brown-ish dogs. The smaller of the two really caught my eye. He was just the most perfect puppy I had ever seen - he was brindled, and his fur looked like a brown tiger pelt. Long, graceful legs, a big ruff, and a sharp face and ears like a fox\'s. His big brown eyes were full of intelligence. I talked to the woman running the booth and found out that they were a non-profit rescue organization run solely by volunteers. She informed us that only the larger of the two dogs was available for adoption. I petted the little guy for a bit and left, but I found myself thinking about him a lot over the next few weeks. I hoped I would be able to find one like him when we were ready to adopt.\n\nI spent the next few months preparing to get a dog - renegotiating the lease to allow for a pet, getting supplies, researching foods, reading up on healthcare and first aid. Finally we were ready to find a dog to adopt. We went to humane society and struck out week after week. I just could not find a good match - none of the dogs felt like they would fit our little family.\nOne day, after yet another disappointing day at the Humane Society, I was half-heartedly browsing Craigslist\'s pet ads when I saw that there was an adoption event a few towns away. We went, expecting to be disappointed.\n\nSure enough, the dogs at the event were not much better. Too energetic, too small, too big, too loud. I gave up, and had started walking back to the car, when a white van pulled into the parking lot. My husband said we should stick around just in case the van was bringing more dogs. Sure enough, the driver got out and let out a single little brown dog. I immediately started walking toward the van, parked about 100 feet away. My heart knew well before my brain could register that I recognized that dog. As I walked faster and faster to the van, I remembered where I had seen him before. I shouted to my husband, "It\'s him! It\'s my dog!".\n\nIt turns out that he was the dog from the expo, and the last of his litter to find a home. No one else wanted him because he was shy and looked unusual. I thought he was beautiful. Within the hour he was buckled up in the backseat in his doggie seatbelt on his way to his new home.\n\nTalk to you again soon.\n\nThanks,\nZachary\nNone'

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am glad to hear back from you.\n\n\nI generally feel a bit uncomfortable sharing personal information with strangers, but I\'d like you to know that you can trust me, so here it is.\n My name is Daniel. My day job is as an account, but I also fight (financial) crime at night. I\'m at the age of 45.  I\'m from England, I live in Reading on Coley Hill.  07622352282 is where I can be reached during the day, unless I am in meetings. I check my daniel.palmer61@gmx.com email frequently, so you could use that. \nAnd that\'s about it. But if you need to find out more, please ask me, and I\'ll try my best to answer.\n\n\n\nLet me tell you a story young person from my past.\n\nI once lived in a small town in the Appalachians. The town was too small to support any kind of hospital, but they had a diner that functioned as both the local watering hole, and the doctor\'s office (the doctor owned the place and also served as the main cook). You could sit at the bar next to someone and not know if they were getting something to eat, or if they were about to get inoculated.\n\nThis town was very very small and remote. The schoolhouse I went to is the smallest public school in that state by a long shot. The senior class (this school went K-12, and still only had about 40 kids, not all of them lived in the town) did a family tree project and discovered that they were all related. Not even distantly; it was like third cousin or something. The punchline, they still held prom.\n\nAlso, our "neighbour" who lived somewhat close as the crow flys, but about 45 minutes driving through mountains, gave my mom her old wood-fired range because she had just been hooked up with electricity and didn\'t need it anymore. Keep in mind that this was the mid 90\'s.\n\nI have too many stories about that place and the crazy folks who live there. I didn\'t think any towns like that still existed, but they\'re out there. They\'re kind of like time capsules. Tell me if you\'d like me to tell you more stories! I have many!\n\nWarm Regards,\nDaniel\n\n\nOn Sat, 24 Mar 2012 18:10:13 +0800 (SGT) <charlie.palmer41@yahoo.com.hk> wrote:\n> FROM HEADQUARTER OFFICE OF THE WESTERN UNION MONEY TRANSFER.Head Office: Ad=\n> dress: 40 Basianghall St, Gipsy Hill SE19, London.\n> \n> \n> United Kingdom\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> ATTENTION CUSTOMER:\n> \n> I am in receipt of your mail.\n> \n> We have been waiting for you to inform us when you want us to send you the =\n> Money Transfer Control Number (MTCN) of your Fifty Thousand British pound d=\n> eposited with us for transfer to you by Commonwealth Lottery Board.

How do I get it into my computer?\n\nI'd like to better understand the circumnstances of the award, so please help me by answering a few questions:\nCan I get my winnings in a different currency? I'd be interested to get them in Australian dollars.\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings.

S"Hello,\n\n\nThis is unbelievable!!! Simply amazing!!! This is the best day of my life. I've been playing many lotteries for over 10 years now, but I've hardly ever won anything.

I can be reached at 07425902430, but beware that I have a hearing problem, so it might be better to contact me at ethanstokes51@yahoo.co.uk. \nAnd that's about it. But if you need to find out more, please ask me, and I'll try my best to answer.\n\n\nI'm sorry this might sound like a stupid question... but how do I send back a photo? I am a bit new to the internet, so I am not sure how these things work yet.\n\nI have a couple of questions, I hope you can answer.\nIs there anything I can do to thank you for this fortune?\nHow do I claim the prize?\n\n\nKind Regards,\nEthan\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 04:57:56 2012 <reparationdesk.office@yahoo.com> wrote:\n> \n> DEAR LUCKY WINNER\n> \n> This is to immediately inform you that your email address with MICROS ID (BKX-321AQ-5HR) has won you $750,000USD (Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars) ; All beneficiaries\n> were selected randomly from Wenzhou Ourvis online networks of Marketing lists Worldwide, Verify your datas; via email: (Mrs.Judy via Email: reparationdesk.office@yahoo.com).\n> \n> FULL NAMES /\n> COUNTRY/\n> DIRECT PHONE NUMBER /\n> OCCUPATION /\n> AGE /\n> SEX)\n> \n> You are to choose from the below options by ticking\n> \n> 1.)

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am glad to hear back from you.\n\nThanks for helping me with the processing of the payment.\n\nLet me tell you a story young person from my past.\n\nI once lived in a small town in the Appalachians. The town was too small to support any kind of hospital, but they had a diner that functioned as both the local watering hole, and the doctor\'s office (the doctor owned the place and also served as the main cook). You could sit at the bar next to someone and not know if they were getting something to eat, or if they were about to get inoculated.\n\nThis town was very very small and remote. The schoolhouse I went to is the smallest public school in that state by a long shot. The senior class (this school went K-12, and still only had about 40 kids, not all of them lived in the town) did a family tree project and discovered that they were all related. Not even distantly; it was like third cousin or something. The punchline, they still held prom.\n\nAlso, our "neighbour" who lived somewhat close as the crow flys, but about 45 minutes driving through mountains, gave my mom her old wood-fired range because she had just been hooked up with electricity and didn\'t need it anymore. Keep in mind that this was the mid 90\'s.\n\nI have too many stories about that place and the crazy folks who live there. I didn\'t think any towns like that still existed, but they\'re out there. They\'re kind of like time capsules. Tell me if you\'d like me to tell you more stories! I have many!\n\nWarm Regards,\nEthan Stokes\n\n\nOn Wed, 21 Mar 2012 08:39:36 -0700 (PDT) <reparationdesk.office@yahoo.com> wrote:\n> ATTENTION: Ethan Stokes.\n> \n> Thanks for your mail,\n> \n> Compliments of the day to you.

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am glad the payment has been approved and we can get the formalities out of the way. I am hoping to receive my winnings soon.\n\nLet me tell you a bit of a weird story from my past.\n\nA few years ago a friend of mine unsuccessfully tried to kill himself by overdosing on pain pills. He was taken to a small hospital in Dover. I was living in Liverpool at the time so some friends as I drove down to check on him. When we made it down to the hospital we were asked to wait outside his room while a nurse was in the room attending to our friend. While we were standing in the hall a man dressed in coveralls walked up to us. He was obviously a mechanic by way of the oil stains on his coveralls and the strong smell of grease. We struck up a conversation with him and he told us he\xe2\x80\x99d been down the street at the local mechanic shop (suspicions confirmed!) and he walked down to check on (what I now assumed to be) our mutual friend. He moved to walk into the room and we told him everyone was supposed to wait outside till the nurse was done in the room. \xe2\x80\x9cIts okay\xe2\x80\x9d he says, pulling a stethoscope out of the pocket of his coveralls \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the Doctor\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nStrange.

Whilst there is no cure for the loss of a family member, I believe that time heals all wounds. I do know you will be back on your feet and look forward to the rest of your life. Please be sure I will do my best to help you.\nPlease allow me to ask you a few questions before we proceed further.\nDo you have a favorite movie? This might be weird, but you sound like a person who would enjoy Titanic!\nInternational transfers and legal fees can be expensive.

S"Hello ERIC JULE,\n\n\nThanks for getting back to me.\n\n\nPlease allow me to introduce myself.\n I am Patrick Turner, it is great to meet you. Please call me Patrick. My day job is as an account, but I also fight (financial) crime at night. I am 35 years of age.  My address is: 83 King Street, Manchester, United Kingdom.  07154942360 is where I can be reached during the day, unless I am in meetings. I check my patrick.turner1@gmx.com email frequently, so you could use that. \nSo this is me. If there is anything I've missed, please tell me and I'll try to answer.\n\n\nI'd like to send you a photo, but I am not very good with computers. Can you please explain how to put it in this letter? If you could, I would be very grateful.\n\n\nI wonder.... What was your favorite subject in school? Mine was definitely basket weaving. The lessons I learned in that class have helped me out a lot in life. And my old teacher, Mr. Geppetto was such a nice guy.\n\nPlease get back to me as soon as possible.\n\nBest Wishes,\nPatrick\n\n\nOn Wed, 21 Mar 2012 12:51:13 +0000 <edad00@live.com> wrote:\n> From: edad00@live.com\n> To: patrick.turner1@gmx.com\n> Subject: Hello Dearest Patrick Turner=2C\n> Date: Fri=2C 16 Mar 2012 08:46:38 +0000\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> Hello Dearest Patrick Turner=2C\n> \n> Thank you very much for your mail reply to my proposal to you.=20\n> Am so sorry to hear that you lost someone you cared deeply.
