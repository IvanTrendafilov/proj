S"Hello Ivan,\n\n\nThis is unbelievable!!! Simply amazing!!! This is the best day of my life. I've been playing many lotteries for over 10 years now, but I've hardly ever won anything. I am happy to know that my luck has now finally turned around.\n\nI understand you would like to find out more about me, so let me introduce myself.\n\nFull name: Ethan Stokes\nOccupation: an accountant\nAddress: 21 Quay Street\nPostcode: M3 4AE\nCountry: UK\nPhone number: 07425902430\n\nAnd that sums me up. Thanks for asking.\n\n\nI need to ask you a few questions.\nDo I have to pay any administration fees to release my prize. If so, can I pay for this from my winnings?\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings. If so, is there a way for me to avoid them?\nHow can I get the winnings delivered to me? Do I get a cheque, a wire transfer or some other method?\n\n\nWarm Regards,\nEthan Stokes\n\n\nOn Mon Mar  5 20:58:49 2012 <ivan.trendafilov@gmail.com> wrote:\n> \n> \n> BLACKBERRY 12TH ANNIVERSARY PROMOTION \n> \n> Blackberry Marketing Centre \n> 67 Shaftesbury Ave \n> Westminster, London \n> United Kingdom W1D 6 \n> \n> Dear Award winner, \n> \n> Winning Reference Number: BBWINXPWISA79822 \n> File number: BB255/647/390 \n> \n> This is to inform you that you have won an Amount of Eight hundred thousand British Pounds (?800,000.00 GBP) in the Blackberry 12th Anniversary Promotion as organized by the Marketing Centre of RIM\xae Inc, held in London, United Kingdom, \n> \n> BlackBerry is a line of mobile e-mail and Smartphone device developed and designed by Research In Motion (RIM\xae).
