S'Hi Timothy,\n\n\nWOOOOOWW!!!! I am literally jumping in my chair right now. This is truly amazing. THANK YOU SO MUCH. This is truly unbelievable. I cannot thank you enough.\nPlease allow me to ask a few questions.\nDo I have to pay any administration fees to release my prize. If so, can I pay for this from my winnings?\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings. If so, is there a way for me to avoid them?\n\n\nThanks,\nDaniel\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 04:01:50 2012 <gentclaime@blumail.org> wrote:\n> \n> It has finally come to our notice that you have not claimed your winning price.

The recent presidential election of November, 28th 2010 in Republic of Cote dIvoire which resulted civil war that just ended last few month ago caused a lot of people to be homeless, parentless and many more. I am 19yrs old girl and sincerely wish to inform you that I will like your assistance in investing in your country as to enable me relocate here to continue my education as the only child of my parents; I lost my father during the civil war because he was suspected to have rendered financial assistance to former president and his elites and my mother died when I was only 4years old. Please let me know your willingness in this project so that I can furnish you with every detail needed. Mean while i have attached my picture and hoping that you will send yours in your next mail.\nSincerely,\nMiss. Mariet Cisse.\n'

S"Dear GEORG,\n\n\nYou say I've won the lottery, but I don't recall entering into that lottery. Through I often enter the National Lottery, I've only won very small prizes once in a while. How do I know this is real? I'm not very computer savvy, so forgive me if I sound not as confident.\n\nI would like to tell you first more about myself.\n\nFull name: Leo Brookes\nOccupation: a store owner\nAddress: 11 Lordswood Road\nPostcode: B17 9RP\nCountry: England\nPhone number: 07851832724\n\nSo I hope this answers your questions. If not, please feel free to ask.\n\n\nI am sorry that I cannot send you a photo with this email, however I am not very good with computers. Would you please explain how I can add it to this letter? How do I get it into my computer?\n\nI'd like to better understand the circumnstances of the award, so please help me by answering a few questions:\nCan I get my winnings in a different currency? I'd be interested to get them in Australian dollars.\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings. If so, is there a way for me to avoid them?\n\n\nWarm Regards,\nLeo Brookes\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 04:54:29 2012 <drmrgeorg.keith@london.com> wrote:\n> \n> \n> DR. MR, GEORG KEITHU.

S"Hello,\n\n\nThis is unbelievable!!! Simply amazing!!! This is the best day of my life. I've been playing many lotteries for over 10 years now, but I've hardly ever won anything. I am happy to know that my luck has now finally turned around.\n\nI would like to tell you first more about myself.\n My name is Ethan. By profession, I am an accountant. I've just turned 47 this month.  I usually don't give out my contact details over the internet, but I'd like to earn your trust. My address is 21 Quay Street, Manchester, UK, M3 4AE.  I can be reached at 07425902430, but beware that I have a hearing problem, so it might be better to contact me at ethanstokes51@yahoo.co.uk. \nAnd that's about it. But if you need to find out more, please ask me, and I'll try my best to answer.\n\n\nI'm sorry this might sound like a stupid question... but how do I send back a photo? I am a bit new to the internet, so I am not sure how these things work yet.\n\nI have a couple of questions, I hope you can answer.\nIs there anything I can do to thank you for this fortune?\nHow do I claim the prize?\n\n\nKind Regards,\nEthan\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 04:57:56 2012 <reparationdesk.office@yahoo.com> wrote:\n> \n> DEAR LUCKY WINNER\n> \n> This is to immediately inform you that your email address with MICROS ID (BKX-321AQ-5HR) has won you $750,000USD (Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars) ; All beneficiaries\n> were selected randomly from Wenzhou Ourvis online networks of Marketing lists Worldwide, Verify your datas; via email: (Mrs.Judy via Email: reparationdesk.office@yahoo.com).\n> \n> FULL NAMES /\n> COUNTRY/\n> DIRECT PHONE NUMBER /\n> OCCUPATION /\n> AGE /\n> SEX)\n> \n> You are to choose from the below options by ticking\n> \n> 1.)
