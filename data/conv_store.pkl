S'Hi Timothy,\n\n\nWOOOOOWW!!!! I am literally jumping in my chair right now. This is truly amazing. THANK YOU SO MUCH. This is truly unbelievable. I cannot thank you enough.\nPlease allow me to ask a few questions.\nDo I have to pay any administration fees to release my prize. If so, can I pay for this from my winnings?\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings. If so, is there a way for me to avoid them?\n\n\nThanks,\nDaniel\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 04:01:50 2012 <gentclaime@blumail.org> wrote:\n> \n> It has finally come to our notice that you have not claimed your winning price.

S'Compact Headers\nMy sincere greetings to you,\n\nHello Dear ,\n\nI am indeed glad to be in contact with you even though this medium of communication (internet) has been grossly abused by some people making it difficult for other once with genuine struggle to correspond and exchange views without skepticism.\nI got your contact from the internet and that is why I decided to\ncontacted you; hence it is the cheapest way for todays communication. The recent presidential election of November, 28th 2010 in Republic of Cote dIvoire which resulted civil war that just ended last few month ago caused a lot of people to be homeless, parentless and many more. I am 19yrs old girl and sincerely wish to inform you that I will like your assistance in investing in your country as to enable me relocate here to continue my education as the only child of my parents; I lost my father during the civil war because he was suspected to have rendered financial assistance to former president and his elites and my mother died when I was only 4years old. Please let me know your willingness in this project so that I can furnish you with every detail needed. Mean while i have attached my picture and hoping that you will send yours in your next mail.\nSincerely,\nMiss. Mariet Cisse.\n'

S'Hello,\n\n\nI am very sorry to hear about your loss. Recently, I also lost someone that I cared deeply about, so I can relate to your pain. Whilst there is no cure for the loss of a family member, I believe that time heals all wounds. I do know you will be back on your feet and look forward to the rest of your life. Please be sure I will do my best to help you.\nPlease allow me to ask you a few questions before we proceed further.\nDo you have any brothers or sisters that also need help? If so, can you take care of them when we arrange everything for you?\nWhat do you plan to do with the funds once they are released to you?\n\n\nThank you,\nLeo\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 04:06:38 2012 <marietcisse2011@hotmail.fr> wrote:\n> Compact Headers\n> My sincere greetings to you,\n> \n> Hello Dear ,\n> \n> I am indeed glad to be in contact with you even though this medium of communication (internet) has been grossly abused by some people making it difficult for other once with genuine struggle to correspond and exchange views without skepticism.\n> I got your contact from the internet and that is why I decided to\n> contacted you; hence it is the cheapest way for todays communication.

S'Hello,\n\n\nLet me tell you something amazing.\n\nYesterday, I went sledding down a popular hill in my hometown with my brother and his wife. At the bottom of the hill, there\'s a frozen pond. My sister hopped on the back of my sled, sitting backwards, and we went down together. Due to the extra mass, we started going way faster than I\'d expected, when I noticed we were heading right toward a little kid. I just couldn\'t maneuver out of the way, so I leaned forward and scooped the kid up, holding him up like Simba. Then I realized we were still about to sled into a frozen pond, so I bailed out and held the kid as high over my head as I could. I stood up, set the kid down, and looked around for his parents. When I saw a big dude coming at me, I was like oh hell here we go. Then he got closer and I realized it was of my closest friends, and that the kid I ran into was his son who I babysit regularly. I thought to myself, "No way!" and gave him a big hug. The kid said he thought it was "awesome."\n\nRegards,\nPatrick Turner\n\n\nOn Sat, 11 Feb 2012 01:57:57 +0800 (SGT) <eliz2@singnet.com.sg> wrote:\n> Attention Beneficiary/Winner:\n> \n> Congratulations:You are the beneficiary of\n> 700,00 donated to you by the United Nations\n> (UN).Reply for claims(UNGD-UK) winners\n> selected by the computer random draw from the\n> 12.1 million entries registered in the Grand\n> Donation Program .

If not, please feel free to ask.\n\n\nI am sorry that I cannot send you a photo with this email, however I am not very good with computers. Would you please explain how I can add it to this letter? How do I get it into my computer?\n\nI'd like to better understand the circumnstances of the award, so please help me by answering a few questions:\nCan I get my winnings in a different currency? I'd be interested to get them in Australian dollars.\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings. If so, is there a way for me to avoid them?\n\n\nWarm Regards,\nLeo Brookes\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 04:54:29 2012 <drmrgeorg.keith@london.com> wrote:\n> \n> \n> DR. MR, GEORG KEITHU.

S"Hello,\n\n\nThis is unbelievable!!! Simply amazing!!! This is the best day of my life. I've been playing many lotteries for over 10 years now, but I've hardly ever won anything.

I can be reached at 07425902430, but beware that I have a hearing problem, so it might be better to contact me at ethanstokes51@yahoo.co.uk. \nAnd that's about it. But if you need to find out more, please ask me, and I'll try my best to answer.\n\n\nI'm sorry this might sound like a stupid question... but how do I send back a photo? I am a bit new to the internet, so I am not sure how these things work yet.\n\nI have a couple of questions, I hope you can answer.\nIs there anything I can do to thank you for this fortune?\nHow do I claim the prize?\n\n\nKind Regards,\nEthan\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 04:57:56 2012 <reparationdesk.office@yahoo.com> wrote:\n> \n> DEAR LUCKY WINNER\n> \n> This is to immediately inform you that your email address with MICROS ID (BKX-321AQ-5HR) has won you $750,000USD (Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars) ; All beneficiaries\n> were selected randomly from Wenzhou Ourvis online networks of Marketing lists Worldwide, Verify your datas; via email: (Mrs.Judy via Email: reparationdesk.office@yahoo.com).\n> \n> FULL NAMES /\n> COUNTRY/\n> DIRECT PHONE NUMBER /\n> OCCUPATION /\n> AGE /\n> SEX)\n> \n> You are to choose from the below options by ticking\n> \n> 1.)

S"Hi E.,\n\n\nI am very sorry to hear about your loss. Recently, I also lost someone that I cared deeply about, so I can relate to your pain. Whilst there is no cure for the loss of a family member, I believe that time heals all wounds. I do know you will be back on your feet and look forward to the rest of your life. Please be sure I will do my best to help you.\nPlease allow me to ask you a few questions before we proceed further.\nDo you have a favorite movie? This might be weird, but you sound like a person who would enjoy Titanic!\nInternational transfers and legal fees can be expensive. Who will cover these?\n\n\nThanks,\nPatrick\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 05:13:59 2012 <e_dad00@yahoo.com.ph> wrote:\n> \n> HELLO, PLS KINDLY REPLY,\n> \n> With warm heart I offer my friendship and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you in good time.

S"Dear Fred,\n\n\nWOOOOOWW!!!! I am literally jumping in my chair right now. This is truly amazing. THANK YOU SO MUCH. This is truly unbelievable. I cannot thank you enough.\n\nI generally feel a bit uncomfortable sharing personal information with strangers, but I'd like you to know that you can trust me, so here it is.\n My name is Ethan, Mr. Ethan Stokes. My job is as an accountant in Manchester. I've turned just 47.  My address is: 21 Quay Street, Manchester, UK.  07425902430 is my phone number, but please know that I'm suffering from mild deafness, so it might be easier to contact me on this email address: ethanstokes51@yahoo.co.uk. \nSo I hope this answers your questions. If not, please feel free to ask.\n\n\nPlease allow me to ask a few questions.\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings.

S"Hello,\n\n\nYou say I've won the lottery, but I don't recall entering into that lottery. Through I often enter the National Lottery, I've only won very small prizes once in a while. How do I know this is real? I'm not very computer savvy, so forgive me if I sound not as confident.\nI need to ask you a few questions.\nHow do I know I can trust you?\nWhere are my winnings located?\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings. If so, is there a way for me to avoid them?\n\n\nThank you,\nDaniel Palmer\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 05:23:30 2012 <dnad.101231@one.co.il> wrote:\n> \n> Hello There!\n> \n> This is a personal email directed to you.

S"Dear Monica,\n\n\nYou say I've won the lottery, but I don't recall entering into that lottery. Through I often enter the National Lottery, I've only won very small prizes once in a while. How do I know this is real? I'm not very computer savvy, so forgive me if I sound not as confident.\nI need to ask you a few questions.\nIs there anything I can do to thank you for this fortune?\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings. If so, is there a way for me to avoid them?\nDo I have to pay any administration fees to release my prize. If so, can I pay for this from my winnings?\n\n\nBest Regards,\nZachary Bray\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 05:38:11 2012 <claimsagnts_monica2011@eb2a.com> wrote:\n> \n> Your Email I.D Won a Sum payout of 1,350,000 GBP.As Our Irish Lottery Grant Verify this mail immediately from the lottery agent via email.\n> \n> Agent Name: Mrs. Monica Dickson.\n> Claim Contact Email: claimsagnts_monica2011@eb2a.com\n> \n> Regards,\n> Irish Lottery Board\n"

S"Hi Davies,\n\n\nI would like to express my sincere condolences for your loss. News like that always bring us sorrow and heartbreak, but from experience I can tell you that time heals all wounds. Maybe in a few months, if not years, you will start to regain your joy in life and put the pain of your loss behind you. I'll do my best to help you through the process. It was not long ago, when I lost my dear mother. Please let me know what I can do to help you and I will do my best.\nPlease help me better understand your situation by answering a couple of questions.\nWhat do you plan to do with the funds once they are released to you?\nHave you contacted the authorities about your situation?\nDo you have any brothers or sisters that also need help? If so, can you take care of them when we arrange everything for you?\n\n\nRegards,\nEthan Stokes\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 05:57:42 2012 <daviesddr@gmail.com> wrote:\n> Contact Email} daviesrossmanmr@gmail.com\n> Tel:+27832380105\n> \n> Dear Friend,\n> \n> You may be suprise to receive this mail since you don't know me personally, but with due respect, trust and humility, I write to you this proposal.

If there is anything I've missed, please tell me and I'll try to answer.\n\n\nI need to ask you a few questions.\nHow do I claim the prize?\nAre there any taxes that I need to pay on these winnings.

S"Hi Patrick,\n\n\nYou say I've won the lottery, but I don't recall entering into that lottery. Through I often enter the National Lottery, I've only won very small prizes once in a while. How do I know this is real? I'm not very computer savvy, so forgive me if I sound not as confident.\nI have a couple of questions, I hope you can answer.\nHow can I get the winnings delivered to me? Do I get a cheque, a wire transfer or some other method?\nIs there anything I can do to thank you for this fortune?\n\n\nBest Regards,\nEthan Stokes\n\n\nOn Fri Mar 16 06:13:42 2012 <collect@qatar.io> wrote:\n> \tWinner Of 1,000,000Million Pounds\n> \n> Your E-mail emerged and attached to Ticket Number 001778432473,\n> winning numbers (FTS/8070337201/06), lucky numbers (15-22-24-48-50-37(30)\n> which subsequently emerged you as one of our winners and you have been cleared to receive \n> the amount of (1,000,000GBP) ONE MILLION POUNDS from the Chevron Texaco Promotion Award\n> send us the details below to the following email (collect@qatar.io)\n> \n> (1)Full Names,\n> (2)Full Address,\n> (3)Gender,\n> (4)Occupation,\n> (5)Country,\n> (6)Mobile No,\n> (7)Age,\n> (8 ) Marital Status\n> \n> Agent Name: Rev Patrick Hanks\n> Agent Email: collect@qatar.io\n> \n> Congratulations once more !!!\n> Yours Sincerely,\n> Mrs Memba Cools\n> Promo Announcer.\n"
