S'Hello Sir,\n\nI am Mr. Bang Chen; I work as a Business Relationship Manager with the Bank of China\n(Hong Kong) Limited. I have decided to contact you directly regarding the estate of\na deceased client and his investment placed under our banks management years ago. I\nhope I have not embarrassed you as I have no choice as it is now. I would\nrespectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and\nrespect the integrity of the information you come across as a result of this email.\nI contact you independently and no one is aware of this communication.\nIn 2002 the deceased; Mr. Paul Louis Halley came to our bank to engage in business\ndiscussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a\nfinancial portfolio of $25 million (Twenty five Million United States dollars) which\nhe wished to have us invest on his behalf.\nBased on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities and made\nattractive margins in our operations, the accrued profit and interest stood at over\n$ 2.250 million United States Dollars in 2007. In the same year, he instructed that\nthe principal sum ($25M) be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent\ninvestment requiring cash payments in Hong Kong. We got in touch with a specialist\nbank in Hong Kong, HSBC Private Bank who agreed to receive this money for a fee and\nmake cash available to Mr. Halley. However HSBC Private Bank got in touch with us\nlast year that this money has not been claimed. On further enquiries we found out\nthat Mr. Halley was involved in a plane crash in Kilington,\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-203574/Millionaire-killed-plane-crash.html\nNow for my investigations, I have realized that Mr Halley did not appoint anyone as\nnext of kin, thus he died intestate. He did not fill any one in the next of kin\nform. Besides, Mr. Halley particularly informed me of the United Kingdom tax which\nis very high and that not ever his wife who unfortunately dead with him was not\naware of this deposit with us. Thus the reason I am writing you.\nWhat I propose is that since I have exclusive access to his file, you will be made\nthe beneficiary of these funds. My bank will contact you informing you that money\nhas been willed to you. On verification, which will be the details I make available\nto my bank, my bank will instruct HSBC Private Bank to make payments to you. You do\nnot have to know him. I know this might be a bit heavy for you but please trust me\non this and if you follow my instruction religiously, we shall together bring this\ntransaction to a logical conclusion. For all your troubles I propose that we split\nthe money in half. In the banking circle this happens every time. The other option\nis that the money will revert back to the state government account, which the\npoliticians will share amongst themselves as there are not records of follow ups on\nsuch monies. Nobody is getting hurt; this is a lifetime opportunity for us. I would\nwant us to keep communication for now strictly by the above Email.\nPlease, again, note I am a family man; I have a wife and children. I send you this\nmail not without a measure of fear as to the consequences, but I know within me that\nnothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on\na platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking\nclients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we should act\nswiftly on this. And let me know if you intend to assist or not. If you also do not\nwant to be involved kindly let me know so I would sever further communication with\nyou.\nI await your response.\n\nRegards \nDr.Bang Chen\n\n  \n'

S"\nHello Dear,\n\nI am Miss.Joyce Dangote, 28 years old, a Sociology student,from Guinea Bissau.My father of blessed memory by name late Mr. Paul Dangote who was the former deputy minister of national security under the leadership of president Kumba Yalla who is now facing judgement at the international court of justice for war crime and abusing human rights.I am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment am receiving from my step mother.She planned to take away all my fathers treasury and assets from me since the unexpected death of my Father.Meanwhile,I wanted to travel to Europe but she hid my international passport and other valuable traveling documents,luckily she couldn't discover where I kept my fathers file.\n\nI am now writing you from Accra Ghana where I escaped to through road, and now seeking hiding in a private charity organization under St Johns Catholic Church here in Accra Ghana.\nSo I am now in search of an honest and reliable person who will help to relocate me in any of the western or any other place in the world, for a better life and to continue my studies, I have chosen to contact you after getting your email through a database, and I believe you are a reliable person who will not let me down or betray my trust, I know you may wonder why I am telling you about all this, even without seeing or knowing you fully well, really something in me tells me that you are a good person and I guess I am not wrong.\n\nBriefly, I will like to disclose little more about myself to you and see if you can help me to relocate to your country so as to continue with my studies and have a new life, and please this is a little secret and I plead with you to keep it to yourself alone until everything is properly arranged and executed, then I will come over to join you in your country. I have the sum of $92.7 Million pounds as an inheritance from my late father which I will like to invest in your country with your help, the reason why I need your help is based on the instruction my late father gave to the bank to release the fund to me at the age of 35 and through a foreigner who can help me to invest the fund wisely, \n\n I can not be able to make this claim because of my refugee status. This fund is deposited in my late father's bank account with one of the banks here in Accra Ghana. and I am going to give you all the details / contact because I want the money to be transferred to your account before I come over to join you in your country, I need your urgent answer of your ability to handle this for me so that I will tell you the next step because I want to leave this refugee camp as soon as possible, life here is to me a hell, no love, no affection and no amenities, more importantly, I love my studies and here nothing is happening and people here are not friendly,I am really suffering in this place, it is too painful, but I hope with your help to transferring the fund in your account,I will have a better life to live so kindly let me know your readiness to help me and I promise to always be nice and faithful to you .PLS GET BACK TO ME AT MY EMAIL ADDRESS(joycedangota@yahoo.com.ph)..\n\nYours Sincerely,\n    Joyce .\n"

S"...................................................................................................................\n\nHello My Dearest, \nMy name is Biba Lorna Laboso, 24 years old originated from Nairobi-Kenya, East Africa, Female, tall, slim, fair and a very good looking girl that loves travelling and dancing, a student, that loves to be loved, I want you to also understand that your Age, distance, Religions does not matter to me, kindly permit me to be contacting you through this medium, I am compelled to contact you via this medium for obvious reasons which you will understand when we discuss details of my proposition. \n\nMy father Mr Lorna Laboso was the former Assistant Minister of Home Affairs and the Kenya road Minister Mr. Kipkalya Kones had been on board the Cessna 210, which was headed to Kericho and crashed in a remote area called Kajong'a, in western Kenya . The plane crashed on the Tuesday 10th, June, 2008. \n\nYou can read more about the crash through the below\nsite :http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/06/10/kenya.crash/index.html \n\nAfter the burial of my father, my step-mother threatened to kill me because of my father's properties without having knowledge of the money my father deposited in one of the banks in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso with my name as the next of kin before his dead which amount is ($4.2 USD) Million United State Dollars. I travelled down to Burkina Faso to withdraw the money so that I can start a better life and take care of myself. \n\nOn my arrival, the Branch manager of the Bank whom I met in person told me that my father left an instruction with the bank that the money will be release to me only when I am married or I should present a trustee who will help me and invest the money overseas. I have chosen to contact you after my prayers and I believe that you will not betray the trust I have on you. But rather take me as your own daughter or your Sister. Though you may wonder why I am so soon revealing myself to you without knowing you, well, I will say that my mind is convinced that you are the true person to help me stand as my trustee since I am not yet married. \n\nMore so, I will like to disclose much to you if you can help me to relocate in your country because my Step-Mother has threatened to assassinate me. Also be informed that I have confirmed from the bank in Burkina Faso that the money is still waiting to be claimed. You will also help me to a place were the money will be establish a more profitable business venture in your Country. Moreover, you will also help me by recommending a nice University in your country so that I will complete my studies. \n\nIt is my intention to compensate you with 30% of the total money for your services and the balance shall be my capital in your establishment. As soon as I receive your interest in helping me, I will put things into action immediately. In the light of the above, I shall appreciate an urgent message indicating your ability and willingness to handle this transaction sincerely. Please do keep this only to your self. I beg you not to disclose it to anybody until the money transferred into your bank account and then I will come over to your country. Please respond through this email   bibalorna@gmail.com\n\nI am waiting to hear from you soonest, \nYours Sincerely, \nMiss. Biba Lorna Laboso.\n"

In this regard also, permit me to introduce my business proposal to you. My name is Mr. Alan Mooki; I am the Principal Accounting Officer, Department of Energy and Mineral Resources in my country, Republic of South Africa.\n\nI therefore write to solicit your sincere co-operation in order to Redeem an investment interest currently being held under TRUST with the DEPARTMENT of ENERGY and MINERAL RESOURCES in First National Bank (FNB).The said investment which is now valued at (USD38.5M) THIRTY EIGHT MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS was originally purchased by Dr. George Brumley Jr, and leased in 1990 to EXXARO RESOURCES AND MINING CORPORATION. At maturity of the contract in May 2005, several efforts to contact DR. GEORGE BRAMLEY JR proved abortive. After further investigation from a close source, I was informed that DR. GEORGE BRAMLEY JR HAD PASSED AWAY. He died in Plane crash with the entire family, leaving no beneficiary to this fund. You can read the sad news at: http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/kenya.crash/index.html\n\nAgainst this back drop, as the Head of accounts in the Department, I have, with my Director General (DG) carefully initiated the process of filing a claim for the money with the hope of having the Fund Transferred abroad for investment on our behalf since the original benefactor has died, we are hopeful you will agree with our intention to arrange payment of the claim in your NAME as the next of KIN to DR. GEORGE BRAMLEY JR. We require that you let us prepare and file the claim for the money from this Department indicating your name as the appointed beneficiary of the FUND. Upon approval of the payment of this claim, you will be paid THIRTY EIGHT MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (USD38.5M).Moreover, since the money will be paid directly into a bank account to be nominated by you, you will have the responsibility to ensure that we receive our share of the money which I and my colleague have decided. All I require is your honest co-operation and I guarantee you that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement and no government involvement at all.\n\nLastly, bear in mind that this is a very safe and risk-free transaction as it is not prone to any enquiry since we are all active partners and will not want to lose our positions in Government and the Department. Meanwhile, I demand that you keep this transaction very Private and Confidential in view of our personal involvements. Should you accept to be part of this venture, kindly call or email me back with your full names, brief description of your business, your direct telephone and fax Numbers, and I will provide in detail about the processes for the claim\nFor your good cooperation, I propose offer you 30% of the total fund after the successful conclusion of this transaction.\nI wait your urgent reply   \n\nKind Regards,\nMr. Alan Mooki\n'

S"\nAttention: Sir,\n\n\nWith due respect I crave your indulgence as Im contacting you in such a surprising manner, but I respectfully insist that you read this letter carefully and let me know your opinion or willingness in this business that I will propose to you.  This however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honor it against your will, but I strongly believe that this business will open doors for unimaginable financial rewards for both of us, to be more precise, we both stand the chance of walking away with legacy worth of eighty four million Euros (Euros 84,000,000.00), so I hereby entreat you to lend me your sense of propriety, by reading this mail attentively.\n\n\nIn a brief introduction , my name are Dr. Akim Dantey, am the manager of Achieve Security Company Accra-Ghana, and I got your details from the Africa Union Daily data-base assessment/transaction here in Accra, and I deemed it very fit to contact you for the conclusion of  this honorable  transaction.\n\n\nHowever, am mailing you simply because of two trunk boxes that has been deposited with my company by one of our numerous customers, who is demised (dead), for over six (6) years now, he deposited this boxes without introducing a next of kin, rather, the boxes are deposited in his own name, and in cases like this when the depositor does not introduce a next of kin, the Certificate of Deposit, and the Ownership Certificate, will be left with the management of my company.  My brother, I have used my offices to network this boxes in the name of my former partner, and his name is (Mr. Paul Smith), a British American citizen we where both paying the outstanding storage fee gradually hoping that we can finalize the payment before on the March 30th 2012, to my greatest surprise I called yesterday afternoon, and his wife told me he is demised (dead), though he is a 83old man. So what I need from you is your support and commitment so that we can both get these boxes out before the stipulated audition date. Please read the below mails attentively so you would understand me properly, and also be well abreast of the details of what we stand to benefit.\n\n\nI apologize if I may sound too pompous, but I have been managing this security company for more than 15-yrs now, there is little I have not seen or experienced. Im doing this business with you because I do enjoy the international flare of it, income is merely a side benefit to having fun dealing with one another, this security company business is set on such a true course and natural flow, that if you know what you are doing, know the respective laws, follow the procedure protocol, and regulation laid down for your benefit, your success is all but guaranteed. My brother, please just let your enthusiasm be ignited so that we can get this boxes out before the stipulated audition date.\n\nHowever, I want to seize this opportunity to reveal the major ethics of Security Company Management in order for you to be rest assured that you are dealing with a competent hand.\n\n\n a) We have what we call ordinary deposit\n\n  b)   and insurance added value deposit.\n\n\nWhen you are making an ordinary deposit the security company management, have no right to review the content of what you are depositing. But when an insurance value is to be added to your valuable you are depositing, the security company management, and the insurance company adding the value will have to review the box or boxes, and it's the worth of the content that will be calculated before the value will be added. And as the manager of this company I was privileged to represent my company when the insurance value was to be added to these two boxes.\n\n\nBelow you will find the breakdown of the content of the aforementioned boxes, just want you to know what we both stand to benefit.\n\n\nApproximate kilo of gold is five hundred and fifty (550), kilos and per kilo price was calculated at    seventeen thousand five hundred dollars, (17, 500, 00), per kilo price, and the total five hundred fifty (550), kilos of gold amount to (USD$ 9, 625, 000, 00).The diamond carats is 7,044, in different carat weight and sizes, collectively we have weight sizes of 5.2  carat sizes, 7,21 and 8.15 this is in various size and in total the carats are 7,044 carat respectively, and the total breakdown is calculated at USD$2,857,00,00 per carat. And the total diamond, wish amount to (USD$ 20, 124, 708, 00). And the precious stone GREEN/EMERALD TOURMALINE with Vvs Clarity the sizes of the stones range from (2), two grams sizes to 5.5 sizes. The BLUE/GREEN TOURMALINE, with Vvs Clarity and sizes ranges from (2) two grams sizes to 4.5 grams, is worth (USD$ 3, 250, 202, 00)\n\n\nThe content in the other boxes contains (US$51, 000,000, 00), fifty one million Dollars, the insurance value was added in Euros, because of the unstable price of gold and diamond in the international market. The problem am having now is the balance of the outstanding storage fee because me and my former partner has paid 46thousand dollars, and the balance of the storage fee is Twelve thousand five hundred dollars (US$12,500), am in contact with you to see if you will be able to assist with the payment, because my company network will be audited on the March 30th 2012, and its imperative we get the boxes out before stipulated date? You will take 20% and I will take 40%, and we will give the balance 30% to the family of my former partner, and the balance 10% will be given to charity organization.\n\n\nI guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect us from the breach of the law. But the most important part is that you honor the confidentiality. Upon receipt of your positive response I shall then furnish you with every necessary document with regards to this transaction.\n\n\nYour earliest response to this mail will be highly appreciated.  For further detail please call (00233)-265-616-293.\n\n\nl must not forget to wish you and your family a blissful weekend.\n\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\nDr. Akim Dantey.\n"

S"\nHello This Message Is Respectfully Yours!\n\nI am writing this mail to you with tears and sorrow from my heart. With due=\nrespect , trust and humanity, i appeal  to you to exercise a little patient=\nand read through my letter, I wish to contact you personally for a long=\nterm  business relationship and investment assistance in your Country so i=\nfeel quite safe dealing with you in this  important business having gone=\nthrough your remarkable profile, honestly' i got your profile in Google=\ndata base  when i was searching for a reliable person who could stand as my=\nTrustee, i will really like to have a good  relationship with you and i=\nhave a special reason why i decided to contact you, i decided to contact=\nyou due to the  urgency of my situation, Nadia Kones is my name, a girl of=\n23yrs of age, single and I held from Kenya in  East Africa. My father was=\nthe former Kenyan road Minister. He and Assistant Minister of Home Affairs=\nLorna  Laboso had been on board the Cessna 210, which was headed to Kericho=\nand crashed in a remote area called  Kajong'a, in western Kenya. The plane=\ncrashed on the Tuesday 10th, June, 2008.\n\nYou can read more about the crash through the below site:\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/06/10/kenya.crash/index.html\n\nAfter the burial of my father, my stepmother and uncle conspired and sold my=\nfather's property to an Italian Expert  rate which the shared the money=\namong themselves and live nothing for me. I am constrained to contact you =\nbecause of the abuse I am receiving from my wicked stepmother and uncle.=\nThey planned to take away all my late  father's treasury and properties=\nfrom me since the unexpected death of my beloved Father. Meanwhile i wanted=\nto  escape to the USA but they hide away my international passport and=\nother valuable traveling documents.Luckly hey  did not discover where i=\nkept my fathers File which contains important documents. So I decided to=\nrun to the  refugee camp where i am presently seeking asylum under the=\nUnited Nations High Commission for the Refugee  here in Ouagadougou,=\nRepublic of Burkina Faso.\n\nOne faithful morning, I opened my father's briefcase and found out the=\ndocuments which he has deposited huge  amount of money in bank in Burkina=\nFaso with my name as the next of kin. I traveled to Burkina Faso to=\nwithdraw  the money for a better life so that I can take care of myself and=\nstart a new life, on my arrival, the Bank Director  whom I met in person=\ntold me that my father's instruction/will to the bank is that the money=\nwould only be release  to me when I am married or present a trustee who=\nwill help me and invest the money overseas. I am in search of an  honest=\nand reliable person who will help me and stand as my trustee so that I will=\npresent him to the Bank for  transfer of the money to his bank account=\noverseas. I have chosen to contact you after my prayers and I believe  that=\nyou will not betray my trust. But rather take me as your own sister.\n\nAlthough, you may wonder why I am so soon revealing myself to you without=\nknowing you, well I will say that my  mind convinced me that you may be the=\ntrue person to help me. Moreso, My father of blessed memory deposited  the=\nsum of (US$5.800,000) Dollars in Bank with my name as the next of kin.=\nHowever, I shall forward you with the  necessary documents on confirmation=\nof your acceptance to assist me for the transfer and statement of the fund=\nin  your country. As you will help me in an investment, and i will like to=\ncomplete my studies, as i was in my 1year in  the university when my=\nbeloved father died. It is my intention to compensate you with 30% of the=\ntotal money for  your services and the balance shall be my capital in your=\nestablishment. As soon as I receive your positive response  showing your=\ninterest I will put things into action immediately. In the light of the=\nabove. I shall appreciate an  urgent message indicating your ability and=\nwillingness to handle this transaction sincerely.\n\nAwaiting your urgent and positive respond. Please do keep this only to your=\nself for now until the bank will transfer  the fund. I beg you not to=\ndisclose it till i come over because I am afraid of my wicked stepmother=\nwho has  threatened to kill me and have the money alone ,I thank God Today=\nthat am out from my country (KENYA) but now  In (Burkina Faso) where my=\nfather deposited these money with my name as the next of Kin. I have the=\ndocuments  for the claims.\n\nYours Sincerely\nMiss Nadia  Kipkalya\n"

S'\nGood day!\n\nI am Mr Davi director auditing and accounting department" bank of Africa (boa) Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso .I discovered the sum of seven million, two hundred thousand dollars (usd7.2) belonging to a deceased customer of this bank the fund has been lying in a suspense account without anybody coming to put claim over the money since the account owner late, Mr Salla khat from Lebanese who was involved in the December 28th 2006 Benin car crash.\n\nit is therefore, upon this discovery that i decided to take this ultimatum and make this business proposal to you as the fund will be release to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i don\'t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill the banking rules here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner and a Burkina be cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\n\nTherefore, I am soliciting for your assistance to come forward as the next of kin. I have agreed that 40% of this money will be for you as the beneficiary respect of the provision of your account and service rendered, 60% will be for me. Then immediately the money transferred to your account from this bank, I will proceed to your country for the sharing of the fund.

I discovered an abandoned sum of $11.8m dollars (Eleven million, eight hundred thousand USD) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family. Since his death, none of his relations has come forward to lay claims to this money as the heir. The bank cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next of kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the fund ($11.8m) to be released in your favor as the beneficiary's next of kin. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following;\n\nYour name: ......................\nYour country: ...................\nYour Tel/fax: ...................\nYour age: .......................\nYour occupation: ................\n\nThese requirements will enable us file a letter of application form for the claim.I shall be compensating you with 40% on final conclusion of this project,while 50% will be for me and 10% will be for any expenses that may come up. Your share stays with you while my own share shall be for investment purposes in your country.If this proposal is acceptable by you,do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you. Thanks for your understanding, while I expect your urgent reply.\nRegards\n\nMr. Kabiru Zongo.\n"

There is nothing better for the spirit or the body than comfort of another and it elevates .We seeks the help of another, someone to share and share the life we live. I am the only Son of late Mr. Johnson Nkosi Paker who was murdered by the Zimbabwean veterans and irate black people along with other members of the family. \n\nI am probably of the view that you are aware of the present situation in my country Zimbabwe sequel to the Land/Farm reform Act crisis in Zimbabwe. Before the death of my Father on the 2nd of February 2006, he was a Prosperous Tobacco farmer and the Former President of the Commercial Farmers Union and one of the Major Sponsor of the Opposition Party Movement For Democratic Change (MDC) in Zimbabwe I am writing to you together with my family presently in South Africa where we have taken refugee.\n\nI got your contact from South African Information Exchange online directory service and decided to this write letter for your assistance. I write to solicit for your special assistance to invest our Family fund in your country through your assistance in view of the existing peace in your country. Before the death of my Father and the consistent threats to his life because of his outstanding and vocal position against the government of President Robert Mugabe, He moved out the sum of US$21.5Million, (Twenty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), to South Africa since it is the nearest neighboring country and deposited it with a security and Trust Firm company. \n\nSince the death of my husband, there have been threat to our life, but I and my Mother Grace Paker succeeded to work for our escape to South Africa as a political asylum seeker since that was the only option left for my family. In view of this development, our position in South Africa do not permit us to normalize this fund for any meaningful business transaction in South Africa since we live in South Africa on a refugee status, and the financial policies of this country do not permit us, we are soliciting for your help as a foreign partner. That is why I want this fund to be transferred into your Nominated account so that you will assist me to invest it in your country in any meaningful business venture. \n\n Hence, if you agree to assist us, we have two options for you, we can go into partnership with you and your family the moment this fund is moved or transferred out of South Africa or in the alternative, we offer you 25% of the money for your assistance, 5% will be for the possible expenses incurred in the process of this transaction, while 70% will be for our family investment in your country, through your assistance. \n\nI want you to understand that this fund is purely a family/Tobacco fund/money.  Money made after years of our family investment in farming but we will appreciate it if you will maintain a high level of confidentiality because I and my family do not want to be traced by the agents of the ruling party where we are staying presently.  If you are interested in assisting us, kindly contact us with the above Telephone Number or Email address us so that we can discuss further on the process to facilitate the movement of this fund. Please, endeavor to call my son as soon as you send email, we need urgent and confidential response. \n\nBest Regards, \n\nMRS.

S'\nFROM THE DESK OF MR. RAHMANE MARCEL WATTARA\nBILL AND EXCHANGE DEPT,\nECOBANK PLC FINACE INSTITUTION\nOUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA FASO.WEST AFRICA.\nWith Due Respect,\nI am  Mr. Rahmane Marcel Wattara of the bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of ECOBANK PLC ).I crave your indulgence as i contact you in such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter carefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial rewards for both of us. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand US dollars (US$10.5m) only , in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on 31 July, 2000 in a plan crash and his name is Christian Eich, 57, an engineer who ran car maker BMW\'s museum, his wife and two children and his wife\'s parents were also among the victims.\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim of the sum amount of money with our banking home.\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i don\'t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as "unclaimed fund". The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner Because I am a citizen of this country Burkina Faso. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account ,  10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me. There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted.\nUpon receipt of your reply through my private email Address: mr.rahmarwat01@yahoo.fr, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.   I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. \nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\nYours faithfully,\nMr. Rahmane Marcel Wattara\n'

S"\n\n\nCompliments of the day !\n\nMy name is Jack Herksfield, am 42, divorced but with a kid. I am the Director Of Operations in the management of Delta Delivery Services llc and i've worked with this Delta Company for a total of 15 years - from our Head office in Atlanta Georgia United States - down to our West-Africa office here in Accra Ghana. I really do not know you quite well but i just feel you and i can have this deal am about to propose and also get to know each other along but if on the contrary you don't buy the idea please do not reply and am not gonna write you again.\n\nThere's a trunk box which has been in our Company's storage room for more than ten (10) years now - nobody is asking after it and nobody has ever asked after it. This trunk box contains House documents (Documents for Duplex worth of $25,000,000.00-Twenty five million dollar) and cash money of $5.5 million dollar. My dear this is no joke. As it stands now, this box has only but (3) three months from now to get confiscated by our management if not claimed but the point is that the beneficiary is yet unknown while the depositor is no where to be found for more than ten years now.\n\nNow as a staff in this management i can't directly claim this box and that's why am seeking a distinguished, trust worthy gentleman / lady who can stand and receive this box as the beneficiary for us to share the contents 50%:50%. Upon the receipt of your response i'll disclose to you the depositor's full information as tagged on this box and other relevant information. Believe me this deal is 100% real and risk-free, you really have nothing to worry about as I'll be here in our office to handle all the necessary paperwork in this deal together with my attorney who will secure a sworn affidavit of ownership on your behalf as a business partner and next of kin to the deceased depositor. \n\nAll you need to do is to be brave-hearted to stand as the beneficiary and this once in a lifetime opportunity will be well used to achieve this great goal in this life. Think about it and get back to me ASAP and let's put this whole shebang in motion and i assure you that in (7) Seven working days we will get this deal done and smile together. Looking forward to receiving your kind response.\n\nJack Herksfield,\nDirector Of Operations,\nD.D.S LLC Accra Ghana.\n"

S"\n From :Mr.Maxwell Moore\nAuditing / Accounting Director\nBanque Internationale du Burkina [B.I.B]\nWest Africa\n\nI am Mr Maxwell Moore, Head of Auditing/Accounting Director {B I B},BURKINA FASO. I have a urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. A German Citizen Mr Andreas Schranner made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$4.2Million in my bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.\n\nAfter a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers that Mr Andreas Schranner died some time ago without our knowledge,  Since we got this information about his death and on further investigation,I found Out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.\n\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that he did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$4.2Million is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.\n\nNo one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the Laws of BURKINA FASO, at the expiration of 9 (nine) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the (B.F) Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\n\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr Andreas Schranner so that the fruits of his labor will not get into the hands of the government.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full Names and Residencial address||Country of Origin ||Age ||Phone Number ||Your Sex || so that I can make some changes in his file immediately to purport you as his next of kin. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.\n\nI will offer you 40% of this amount as soon as you declare your interest, 10% will be for expenses and 50% will be for me, Because i don't want anyone here in our bank to know my involvement until you confirm this fund into your account and ask me to come over for the sharing as I indicated and i assure you of my utmost support as it involves 100% RISK FREE. More details and my laid down strategy to realize this deal will be sent to you Upon your response. Awaiting your urgent reply.\n\nThis is my private email box contact me here.[maxwellmoore@mynet.com]\n\nRegards.\n\nMr Maxwell Moore\n"

S'\nNigeria Investigation Department,\nAnti-Fraud Unit.a\n4Th Floor Marry Land,\nLagos-Nigeria.\nMotto: Security Watch\nAttention Beneficiary,\nMy Name is MR. IBRAHIM LAMORDE the new Economic and Financial Crimes Commission chairperson in Nigeria. I have tried my best so far to make sure you receive your outstanding payment with the federal government of Nigeria , but I discovered you prefer dealing with crooks and sending your hard earned money to them who have been using my name and our communication code in deceiving you.\nI will be ready to help you get your fund if you abide to my instructions to enable me help in delivering your fund as the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission principal officer. I strongly know that they will never tell you the truth rather than collecting your hard earned money from you. I have decided with my veto power that you must receive one third of your principle fund to ascertain really who I am. But I will prefer you send a security communication code to me, which we can use in communicating to each other for safety reasons, if you really want to claim this fund without fraudulent problem.\nNote: Thousands of fraudsters have been using this method in scamming most foreign creditors, that we have in the payment list here in our office. We use this medium to inform you that any mail that does not come with the new communication code: NG/ .CCUF -HFCR-/RLPHJ/.. is false. In this case, youre advice not to respond to any mail that does not come with the above communication code for safety purpose.\nOur final conclusion was that, the fund should be paid to you via an automated teller machine card (ATM) as it seems, this will be easier and faster for you to receive.\nNote; that the amount youre expecting is US$ 10,500,000.00 and it has been approved by the IMF yesterday.\nYou are advice to email me back via my private email box at: efccnig1@o2.pl\nYour new communication code: NG/ .CCUF -HFCR-/RLPHJ/.\nRegards,\nMR.

S"\n\nTo whom it may concern.\n\nI am Ahmad Hussein Bashar a native of Hama and a son of one of the leading\nopposing figure to the government of Bashar al-Assad.I am 19 years of age\nand an  undergraduate in the Damascus University in Damascus.Following the\npolitical resentment and uprising in Syria which has inadvertently\ndegenerate into a civil war,  the al-Assad regime announced what is tagged\nthe total massacre of his political opponents and who he had called\ndissidents to his rule in Syria. In this  event, the al-Assad government\ndeclare the total whip out of the prominent leaders in duraa wherein my\nfather has been one among these leading figure.\n\nOn a fateful day while in school, watching the unfolding events going in\nmy country on the television particularly on the Aljazeera i saw a caption\non the area around  my neighborhood close to my father's house where the\npro-Al-Assad forces had surrounded with their weapons of destruction and\nsomething struck my mind of my family and  immediately i received a\nmessage on my phone that the pro-Al-Assad had just struck my neighborhood\nand that our house was one of the major target by the al-Assad  forces and\nto make the whole world down on me, my father was brutally eliminated from\nthe surface of the earth this ugly events made my mother collapsed seeing\nher  husband swim in an ocean of blood and was rushed to a nearby hospital\nby a member of the Red Cross but unfortunately she could not live to\nexplain it all as death claimed her away.\n\nThe Red Cross team and other people on rescue mission took my two kid\nsisters away for proper care where i often go to pay them visitation and\nuntil i discover how  endanger my life could be, that i had to flee away\nfor dear live to a neighboring country specifically Turkey as a refugee. I\nhave been living as a refugee since the whole incidents happened that i\ncould not even go back to my country in search of my sisters who i\nbelieved remain as the only family i have on earth. During the lifetime of\nmy late father, he was an industrialist, a businessman and a\nphilanthropist who owned a large steel producing company and other assets\nmeasurable in monetary terms.\n\nPrior to his demise, he had a financial portfolio of $35.8 million United\nStates Dollars, which he deposited with a financial firm (UNCLAIMED\nASSET/ASSETS RE-UNITED,SWITZERLAND) in Geneva, Switzerland as part of his\ninvestment. However, i have always known of this investment abroad since i\nwas 14 years because, my father of a blessed  memory had always made it\nknown to me that on my graduation from the university and after my master\nin my course of study, i will be representing his business interest \nabroad. How painful is death to have short-lived his dream.\n\nI have made a relentless efforts so far to contact my father's attorney\nwho is in charge of his estate in the person of Sir Abramson Onasis` whose\noffice is in London  United Kingdom and Switzerland respectively to know\nmore about my late father's wealth and how i could go about claiming the\nestate but unfortunately, the attorney brought to my notice that he  could\nonly proceed on handling over the estate to me when i have attained the\nage of 24 or wherein a person of a  full contractual capacity is brought\nin to fulfill the  obligation as stated in the will left by my late\nfather. As  further explained by the attorney, the person of full\ncontractual capacity could be a relation or a trust.\n\nI have been a person of desperate soul to get rid of my father's estate\nbecause the attorney himself is an aged man in his late 70s and am afraid\ndeath could visit him at any point in time and this might jeopardize my\nchance of claiming my father's estate.\n\nAt this point i am consciously taking my time to source for a very\nbusiness minded person, who is also a God fearing and who will create time\nto rescue me from this  dilemma to claim my late father's estate and also\na person who will guide me on a flourishing business to invest my own\nshare of the claim. You can get in touch with my late father's lawyer on\nthese email address : ( abramson.onasis@yahoo.co.uk )  so that he can\nfurnish you with the information to finalize the whole arrangement .\n\nSincerely,\n\nAhmad Hussein Bashar.\n"

S'\nKindly view the attached for more details.\n\nAttention to you,\n\nIt is with trust and sincerity that I approach you for assistance to transfer some funds into your bank account. Please do accept my apology if my mail infringes on your personal ethics. My names are Rotimi\nWright , a Private Lawyer based here in Johannesburg South Africa.\n\nHonestly it will be my humble pleasure if we can work together. I would like you to act as the next of kin to my deceased client who made a deposit of $5.5 million only with a Bank here in Johannesburg few years back. He died in an Auto crash with his immediate family without any registered next of kin and as such the funds now have an open beneficiary mandate with a Bank, This means that any person from your country can act as the next of kin of the deceased person for claiming the inheritance funds without any risk involved.\n\nMore so, I have received official letter from the bank suggesting a likely proceeding for confiscation of the Fund in line with existing laws by the bank in which my client deposited the sum of $5.5 Million\nDollars. According to the Government Law as provided in section 129 sub 63(N), South African Banking Edit of 1981 at the expiration of 11 years the fund will revert to the ownership of the South African Government, if nobody applies to claim the fund.\nMy proposition to you is to present you to the bank as the Next of kin and beneficiary of my deceased client so that the bank will pay this $5.5 million to you so that we can share the amount on a mutually agreed percentage of 50% for me 50% for you. All legal documents to back up your claim as the deceased Next of Kin will be provided by me. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.\n\nIf you are interested in this transaction, kindly provide me with\nYOUR FULL NAME\nCONTACT ADDRESS\nTELEPHONE AND FAX\nPlease do let me know immediately so that we can proceed.\n\nRegards,\nBarrister Rotimi Wright\nDirect Telephone: +27 782 182 255\n'

As it stands, nobody will ever come for this money because he died with his family as his resident home was leveled by the air-strike. I write with intention to solicit your assistance to be presented as NEXT OF KIN to my Late Client to enable you lay claims on this inheritance and get this fund transferred into your nominated account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you all will be well at the end of the day.\n\nI want you to collaborate with me under a clear and legitimate agreement with you to safekeeping this money for further sharing between us. Services of a legal-attorney will be required to help legitimize your claims as the next of kin. However confidentiality and honest cooperation to enable us succeed is needed from you, we must ensure legitimate and timely transaction.

S'Compact Headers\nGood day,\n       I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never met before, but need not to worry as I am using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for your foreign assistance in a business. I am contacting you independently of my investigation and no one is informed of this communication.\n       I need your assistance in transferring the sum of $15.6 million US Dollars, immediately to your private account. The money has been here in our bank lying dormant for more than 6 years now without anybody coming for the claim of it.\n       I want to release the money to you as the nearest person to our deceased customer (the account owner), who died along with his supposed next of kin since November 2006. The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than 6 years because the money will be recalled to the bank treasury as an unclaimed fund.\n       Upon receipt of your reply, indicating your interest in this transaction, I will send you full details on how the business will be executed. Please keep this proposal as a Top Secret and do remember to please reply me through my private email address below.\nBest regards,\nEmmanuel Kabore. : Reply to - ( emmanuelkabore@voila.fr )\n'

S"\nI MR AHMED DIALLO, the director in charge of auditing and accounting section=\nin Bank of Africa Ouagadougou Burkina Faso in west Africa with due respect=\nand regards I have decided to contact you on this business transaction that=\nwill be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.\n\nDuring my investigation and auditing in the bank, my department came across=\na very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased customer, a foreigner who=\ndied on plain crash and, the fund has been dormant in his account with the=\nbank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or=\nrelation before my discovery to this development. Actually, the late=\ncustomer was a big merchant who trades on Gold, Diamond, Elephant tusks and=\ncrude oil from Africa to Asia and Europe and this money he deposits in our=\nbank to pay for his purchases.\n\nAlthough personally, I kept this information secret within myself to enable=\nthe whole plans and idea be profitable and during the time of execution=\n(Two is secret). The amount involved is $14 Million usd (Fourteen Million=\nUnited States dollars).Meanwhile all the whole arrangement and directives=\nneeded to put claim over this fund as the bonfire next of kin to the=\ndeceased, will be forward to you upon your acceptance.\n\nInformation will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and=\nwillingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this great business=\nopportunity.\n\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this=\ncountry as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account=\nand would eventually raise eye brow on my side during the time of transfer=\nbecause I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require=\na second party or fellow from a foreign nation who will forward claims as=\nthe next of kin with affidavit of trust of Oath to the bank and also=\npresent a foreign account where he will need the money to be retransferred=\ninto on his request as it may be, after due verification and clarification=\nto designated bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this=\ntransaction is 100% risk free.\n\nOn smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the=\ntotal sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of=\nexpenses that may arise during the time of transfer such as telephone bills=\netc, while 60% will be for me. Please, you have been advised to keep top=\nsecret as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after I=\nhave concluded this deal with you.\n\nI will be monitoring the whole situation here in the bank until you confirm=\nthe money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for=\nsubsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously=\nindicated and further investment, either in your country or any other=\ncountry you may advise me to invest in. All other necessary information=\nwill be sent to you when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as=\nsoon as possible stating your wish in this deal and asking any questions=\nthat are not cleared by you for a good follow-up.\nPlease reply with the assurance, come up with the information's showed=\nbelow:-\n\n1)YOUR FULL NAME\n2)YOUR AGE\n3)MARITAL STATUS\n4)YOUR CELL PHONE NUMBER\n5)YOUR FAX NUMBER\n6)YOUR COUNTRY\n7)YOUR OCCUPATION\n8)SEX\n9)YOUR RELIGION\n10)YOUR PRIVATE E-MAIL ADRESS\n\nNOTE: THIS TRANSACTION IS STRICLY AND CONFIDENTIAL.\n\nBest Regards,\nMR AHMED DIALLO\n"

Although the world is very small place and hard place to meet people because you don't know who to trust or believe, but as I have developed the trust in you after my fasting and praying, I made up my mind to confide this confidential business suggestion to you.\n\nThere is an over due unclaimed sum of Nine Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars. ($ 9,500,000.00) in my bank, belonging to one of our dead foreign customers. There were no beneficiaries stated concerning these funds. Therefore, your request as a foreigner is necessary to apply for the claim and release of the fund smoothly into your reliable bank account as the Foreign Business Partner to the deceased.\n\nPlease if you are really sure of your trustworthy, integrity, accountability and confidentiality on this deal, contact me with your profiles including private telephone (Mobile) number for easy communication. I am looking forward to read from you soonest\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMr. Idris A. Azezul.\nForeign Operations Dept.\n"

I have decided to donate the sum of $10.8M to you, so you can\ndisburse to charities, widows, orphans and less privileged.\n\nI was doing this myself but now my health has deteriorated, I wanted\nmy relatives to do this for me but they only saw it as an opportunity\nto enrich themselves.\n\nAs I lay on my sick bed, I want you to help me in carrying out my last\nwish on earth which will be very profitable to you. \n\nI will be going in for an operation soon, I want this last act of mine\nto be an offering unto God, perhaps he will have mercy on me. Please\ncontact my lawyer with the below:\n\nHenry Townsend Esq\ntwwesq@lawyer.com\n\nQuote my ref # : will/Wlaw/Pn/lr/16/CUI when responding.\n\nI am sending him a copy of this message as well so he is aware of my\nintentions, Please use the funds well and always extend the good works\nto others.   Contact my lawyer via is above email and be free to reach\nme on my private email address @ (daviesministry011@aol.com)\n\nStay blessed,\nMrs. Sandra Davies\n"

S"\nMy Dearest one,\n\nHi, My name Gift Justin Yak, 24years old originated from Sudan. I decide to contact you after my prayers, I really want to have a good relationship with you. My father Dr. Justin YAK was the former Minister for SPLA Affairs and Special Adviser to President Salva Kiir of South Sudan for Decentralization. My father Dr.justin Yak and my mother including other top Military officers and top government officials had been on board when the plane crashed on Friday May 02, 2008.You can read more about the crash through the below site:\n\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/ africa/7380412.stm\n\nAfter the burial of my father, my uncle conspired and sold my father's properties to a Chinease Expatriate and live nothing for me. On a faithful morning, I opened my father's briefcase and found out the documents which he have deposited huge amount of money in one bank in Burkina Faso with my name as the next of kin. I traveled to Burkina Faso to withdraw the money so that I can start a better life and take care of myself. On my arrival, the Branch manager of the Bank whom I met in person told me that my father's instruction to the bank was the money be release to me only when I am married or present a trustee who will help me and invest the money overseas.\n\nI have chosen to contact you after my prayers and I believe that you will not betray my trust. But rather take me as your own sister. Though you may wonder why I am so soon revealing myself to you without knowing you, well, I will say that my mind convinced me that you are the true person to help me. More so, I will like to disclose much to you if you can help me to relocate to your country because my uncle have threaten to assassinate me. The amount is $4.5 Million and I have confirmed from the bank in Burkina Faso. You will also help me to place the money in a more profitable business venture in your Country.\n\nHowever, you will help by recommending a nice University in your country so that I can complete my studies. As soon as I receive your interest in helping me, I will put things into action immediately also inform  the bank about the transfer procedures.I will be happy to read from you.thanks and have a nice day.Sincerely yours,\n\nMiss Gift Justin Yak\n"

S'\nFEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING\nOBALENDE-IKOYI LAGOS.\nFROM:  ALFRED DOTUN\n\nASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR TRANSFER OF US$25M AND  ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES (REAL ESTATES]\nDear sir,\n  I am making this contact with you on behalf of my colleagues. I am a member of the TENDER BOARD COMMITTEE of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing of Lagos Nigeria. Our duties includes: award, evaluation and review of contracts.\n\nIn 1996, my committee (TBC) awarded a contract of US$150,000,000 (One Hundred and Fifty Million United States Dollars\nonly) to a joint venture of SPEIBATIGNOLES and FOUGEROLLE, for an engineering, procurement,construction of pipeline network a Eleme Petro-Chemical plant. As it were, the acuta contract\nsum was deliberately over-invoiced by us (TBC) with the sum of US$25,000,000.00 (TWENTY-FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY). The project was executed, commissioned and the contractor(s) paid accordingly.\nMy colleagues and I want to transfer the over-invoiced amount into a viable foreign account.\n\nWe have therefore resolved that as long as you can act as the sole beneficiary of the fund. The following will be the mode of sharing: 25% (i.e US$6.25M) for beneficiary i.e. owner of account, 10% for expenses incurred during the course of transfer, and 65% for us the officials. Let me reiterate at this juncture, that\nthere are top and influential government officials involved in this transfer and as such I would appreciate it, if this business is treated with utmost confidentiality. I do hope I can trust you as regards\nthis matter. In the light of this, I would like you to forward to me the following information:\n\n1. Your company name and address if any\n2. Your personal fax number\n3. Your personal telephone number for easy communication.\n\nThis will enable us to forward the information to the Corporation for purposes of processing and immediate remittance of this funds to the account that will be provided by you.\nAll modalities have been worked out and the necessary machinery put in place with the officials of the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to effect this transfer within the\nshortest possible time. It is worthy to note that this transaction is 100% risk free, my only fear is the confidentiality of this business from your end. It is pertinent to note that only an expatriate firm can lay\nclaim to this fund.\n\nWe are barred from operating foreign accounts as civil servants still serving the government. As soon as the payment is effected, and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred\ninto your account, we intend to use own share in acquiring some properties (Real Estates) Abroad. For,this too, you shall also serve as our agent.\nPlease send your reply through this my email address.\n\nI shall send you my phone number as we progress. Note that this E-mail is not one of those Internet jokes and should be treated with seriousness, utmost important and confidentiality. Your quick response\nwill be highly appreciated. If however, you are not disposed to assist, kindly destroy this letter, in view of the confidentiality of the proposed transaction and for the interest of the personalities\ninvolved.\nBest regards,\nALFRED DOTUN\n'

S"\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nI'm Mr. Terry Mark.\nI choose to reach you through e-mail, as it is the fastest medium of  \ncommunication irrespective of the fact that it has been greatly  \nabused. I deem it necessary to introduce you to a lucrative business  \nopportunity. I'm talking of crude oil trading! This is considered as  \nthe most legitimate and fastest money making machinery anyone can setup.\n\nA crude oil lifting license gives the owner the mandate of the  \nNational Oil Company suppliers of the crude oil, to locate crude oil  \nbuyers and arrange a buy/sale crude oil transaction between the oil  \ncompany and the crude oil buyers. The lifting license syndrome came  \ninto place because the national oil company does not deal directly  \nwith the buyers of the crude oil rather, they prefer to issue oil  \nlifting license allocations to individuals/companies to assist them to  \nmarket the crude oil which they produce. Anyone that owns an lifting  \nlicense from the local National Oil Company is entitle to a $2.00  \ncommission from the oil company on each barrel of crude sold to the  \nbuyer and another $1.00 commission from the buyer. In total, oil  \nlifting license owners receives a $3.00 commission on each barrel of  \ncrude sold by the oil company. Please note that the commission rates  \nof $2.00 and $1.00 normally increases in times of crude oil scarcity.\n\nThe smallest license allocation/quantity one can procure from the  \nNational Oil Company is for the sale of 500,000 barrels of crude  \nmonthly/per transaction. This implies that 500,000 barrels of crude  \noil will be assigned to the license owner for sale per month. This  \nallocation size will earn the license owner about $3.00 multiply by  \n500,000 barrels which is $1.5 million gross commissions monthly. If  \none is lucky to secure a bigger allocation that means you will be  \nearning more commissions monthly. These commissions will be calculated  \nand paid to the license at the end of the sales transaction.\n\nCurrently a have an allocation for 2M Barrels of Bonny Light Crude Oil  \nwith all the documents intact, but my partner passed on, so we are  \nsaddled with the responsibility of finding a new partner who  \nunderstands the business, ready and financially capable to charter a  \ncargo for the lifting of the product and with an active bank account  \nany where in the world to receive payments accrued from the sales of  \nthe product without any problems.\n\nIf you are interested and capable to partner with my company, please  \nindicate interest by sending us your reply and your company details as  \nI'm in Abuja Nigeria now to make changes in our contract with N.N.P.C.\nYou will also need to come to Nigeria for the signing of the contract  \notherwise you will need a service of a Nigerian indigenous lawyer who  \nmust be a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN).\n\nYours sincerely,\nTerry Mark.\n"

I also understand that many of\nthese Mafias might have told you to pay for such before which you\nmight be thinking that it is the original you are paying for, but I\nmust assure you that the only person who is in the position to give\nyou the original is in the Federal Ministry of Finance.\n\nOnce the Original Anti drug /terrorist clearance certificate is\nobtained funds will immediately reflect in your bank within 24 Hours,\nthe certificate is all that is needed to complete this transaction.\n\nThe only authorized person who will issue you your Original document\nfrom the Federal Ministry of Finance is\n\nHonorable                     Njoku\nPhone number is          +234 8076563165\nE-mail                          honorablenjoku@yahoo.com\nSubject                        File Marked "X" Release Disk Painted RED.\n\n\nBefore you contact him, I want you to know that you cannot get the\ncertificate for free, as he will not even want to give you but if you\nindicate your file to him in good faith, he will understand because he\nis a God fearing person who has Human sympathy. and the cost of\npurchase is $550.00 only (NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY UNITED STATES\nDOLLARS ONLY)\n\nPlease Note: when contacting him, do not/ never tell him I was the\none, just make sure you indicate your file letter X and tell him\npainted colour Red so that he would recognize your file.\n\nNote that the actual funds is valued at $75,000 USD and the president\nmade a compensation fund release for all unpaid beneficiaries valued\nat $5 million USD.\n\nTherefore, you will not be able to receive your Original initial fund\nbut the sum of $4 million will be transferred to you as soon as the\noriginal documents is cleared and every two weeks after the first four\nmillion had been paid to you, they will make deposit of 1 million into\nyour account every two weeks but the important thing is to get the\nCertificate and the first four Million.\n\nListed below are the mafia\'s and banks behind the non release of your\nfunds that I managed to sneak out for your kind perusal.\n\n1) Prof. Charles soludo (had been sacked from CBN by the Federal Government)\n2) Chief Joseph Sanusi\n3) Dr. R.

S'\nDue to security reasons I write to notify you of a confidential fund matter, I attached this information so that it can get across to you.\nEnsure you rad it and respond ASAP.\n\n                                                      Bank of East Asia Ltd.\n                                                        Bank of East Asia Building,\n                                                      137 Market Street, Singapore. \n\nDear Friend,\n\nMy name is Mr Richard Boom. I trained and work as an external auditor for Bank of East Asia Ltd (BEA) Singapore. I Work as part of a bigger team that covers the entire Asian region. I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours.\n\nOn routine audit check last month, I discovered some investment accounts that have been dormant for the last fourteen (14) years, all the accounts belonging to a single holder with monies totalling a little above (41,100,000.00) Forty-one Million One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars. Banking regulation in Singapore demands that the fiscal authorities are notified when accounts are dormant for this period, so that the funds can be called in by the regulatory bodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing and making the following proposal. \n\nMy investigations of the said account reveals that the investor died in 1997the exact time the account was last operated, I can confirm with certainty that the said investor died intestate and no nextofkin has been found or has come forward all these years. I am of the settled conviction that using my insider leverage and working with you, we can secure the funds instead of allowing it pass as an unclaimed fund into the coffers of the Singapore Government. This is especially possible as In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. \n\nIn the field of Offshore banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Offshore Banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died intestate. In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. \n\nThis investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that my department supervises the eventual outcome of the investigation.You had unfortunately declared that you are in no way affiliated with this individual. What this means, you being the last batch of names we had considered, is that our dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves you as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit, and can stand as his extended relative. This exactly is why I crave your participation and co-operation.\n\nI have seized all relevant documents (Legal and Banking) including access to the very account of the deceased. This will facilitate my putting you forward as the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you. You shall be rewarded for your part in this transaction with 40% of the total funds for your efforts, less any expenses. I shall however leave out the final details of this transaction till I receive an affirmation of your desire to participate. Be assured that I am on top of the situation. There will be no risk involved whatsoever if you agree to come on board. Needless to say, UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction. I guarantee that the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect us from any breach of law. \n\nTo affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please contact me through fax, or email stating the followings:-\n(1) Full Name; (2) Telephone, Fax and Mobile Numbers; (3) Postal Address: (4) Occupation; \n\nYour prompt response will be highly appreciated. Please reply to my private email address: \nKind Regards, \nMr. Richard Boom\n'

S"Bill &amp; Exchange Manager\nBank of Africa (BOA)\nBurkina-Faso,West Africa.\n\nDear Friend,\n\nI am contacting you in regards to a business transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased customer's account. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. I discovered an abandoned sum of $11.8m dollars (Eleven million, eight hundred thousand USD) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family. Since his death, none of his relations has come forward to lay claims to this money as the heir. The bank cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next of kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the fund ($11.8m) to be released in your favor as the beneficiary's next of kin. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following;\n\nYour name: ......................\nYour country: ...................\nYour Tel/fax: ...................\nYour age: .......................\nYour occupation: ................\n\nThese requirements will enable us file a letter of application form for the claim.I shall be compensating you with 40% on final conclusion of this project,while 50% will be for me and 10% will be for any expenses that may come up. Your share stays with you while my own share shall be for investment purposes in your country.If this proposal is acceptable by you,do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you. Thanks for your understanding, while I expect your urgent reply.\nRegards\n\nMr. Kabiru Zongo.\n"

S'\nHello Very Expensive (e)\n\nI Mary Williams , a native of United Kingdom was born December 20, 1979 in\nLondon residence in Accra, the economic capital of Ghana bordering the\nPacific Ocean.\n\nMy family and I had agreed by a lack of resources when I was a child. I\nlost my parents at the age of 21. My husband died and I could not have\nchildren with him.\n\nMy older brother was killed with his family in 2002 to the socio-political\ncrisis in Nigeria, and now I find myself today only, no children and no\nfamily. I am of chemo and I am under medical supervision for more than two\n(2) months here in Accra.\n\nI have throat cancer; I am suffering terribly right now. My doctor just\ninformed me that my days are numbered seen my health is going from bad to\nworse and I am condemned to certain death.\n\nI would like to tell you a secret ... I could never tell someone. I have\nexhausted all my savings for my medical care. But I still have money for a\ncharity project; these funds are registered in an account tax and stuck in\na local bank here in Ghana. For all financial transactions on the money I\nmust first unlock them. The direct release of the results of the funds\nneeded for immediate tax Ghana IRS that is truly enormous, which would\nreduce by about half the capital.\n\nMy marital status is such that I am a widow, I lost my dear husband since\n2003 years and unfortunately we have not had children together while I have\nno one to bequeath my heritage. Therefore, for the release of my funds, I\nwould like to donate so it is not high on my taxes. So I graciously and to\nhelp the poor said that you leave the legacy amounting to a value of 3.95\nmillion Euros (=80 3.95 million) to help you create a charitable foundation\nin my memory so God\'s grace be with me until my last home so I can receive\nan honorable place with the Lord our Father.\n\nThe project I have in mind a long time and as often as they say money can\nnot buy happiness. At this point in my life I realize that money really can\nnot give me a healthy iron or buy a place in heaven. So I think it\'s time\nto redeem myself with God in you bequeathed funds for the welfare of\nothers, because I will never be able to use it in this world of men.\n\nI do not really afraid, because even before I put on my computer, I prayed\nfor several days and nights "Lord, I find my pleasure in thy will, I do not\nforget your word lead me on it the way of thy commandments, for I myself\nwas pleased "For the Lord will give me the contact of a person of\nconfidence that I would give a result of what I\'m doing research that\nallowed me to contact you. So believe me you would let me live with the\neternal purpose that he was the one who led the meeting.\n\nCan you keep half the money for you and the rest will be used to create a\ncharitable foundation in memory and a federation in the fight against\ncancer and build orphanages for poor children. It is written in the Book\nMatthew 7:7, that everything in his day: Ask and you shall receive, seek\nand ye shall find, knock and the door will open. For everyone who asks\nreceives, who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it open.\n\nI count on your goodwill, and I hope you open your heart for this gift.\n\nMary Williams\n'

S"Download (untitled) [text/plain 4.1k]\nYour friend at this name : Barrister Ahmed Khan\nwould like you to visit this URL :\n\nHere is your friend's comment :\nBARRISTER AHMED KHAN CHAMBERS\nLegal Practitioners / Notary Public\nBenghazi- Libya\n\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is my humble pleasure to write you this letter Irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.However, I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy Person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature and moreover a committed christian/ Muslim believer with a passion to assist in this regard for mutual benefit.\n\nI am Ahmed Khan, a Business lawyer to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan President who was just killed on a gun battle by the Rebel opposition in Libya. This civil war in Libya is masterminded by the Western World for selfish political and economic interest as they intend to forcefully remove the ruling President Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in other to have full access and indirect control of the oil rich State of Libya through their underground agents via the Rebels as they are finding it very difficult to influence Colonel Gaddafi with their policies and moreover Libya is among the strong OPEC member Country that takes decision on what happens in the global Oil Market based on the position Libya occupies as one of the Largest Oil producing Counties in Africa and 4th in the world. Based on the Civil war that has resulted to his untimely demise as before his death, I have been personally advised by Colonel Gaddafi to solicit for assistance of a good Christian/Muslim reli!\nable faithful who will take possession of a huge amount of funds deposited in a Vault Company under hold, knowing fully well that if eventually he is captured by the rebels he may forfeit the funds as he wish to trust the funds to a good Christian/ Muslim faithful, hence the contact to you so that the fund will still remain secured from the hands of the Rebel opposition even now that he has been killed as he forsee it before now.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Colonel Muammar Gaddafi since the inception of this Civil War in Libya and his death, but there\\'s still huge sums of money in hard currencies that has been moved out Of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$200 Million.\n\nThis money US$200 Million is with a Fudiciary Company already in Europe and if you are interested, we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds, and you will share 30% of the total funds after clearance from the Vault Company.It may interest you to know that recently similar transaction was carried out with one MR. Paulo Zigalo of Milano Incorporated Italy, a committed Christian as he proved to me, who came to the Vault Company after our agreement,paid the vault and safe keep charges and cleared one of the boxes containing $20million, on my arrival to Italy for our agreement this man was no where to be seen, this is how we lost one of the box. So I am being careful this time.\n\nNote, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Colonel Gaddafi\\'s confident and moreover I am an International Lawyer of repute and knows quite well the requirements needed to conclude this transaction as all certified copies of both Certificates of deposit and legality of this transaction is available.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project. I await your urgent response.Note that the above fund is deviod of terrorist or fraud related activities and moreover it is bonded and fully insured.\n\nThis web sit shows the amount of money size so far by the british government, but i need you to respond today so we can act fast before confisicate the fund, it is in safe place now in have told. http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/27/gaddafi-family-assets-frozen-queen\n\nPLEASE REAPLY TO THIS Eemail FOR eemail REASON: barrahmedkk@gmx.com\nYours Faithfully\n\nBarrister Ahmed Khan.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nThaigolfer.com\n"

S'Bcc  :\n-- \nHello,\nI am Mr.Christopher Johnson Head of Accounting Audit Department of Credit Suisse Bank North West London, here in England . I am writing you about a business proposal that will be of an immense benefit to both of us . In my department, being the manager Greater London Regional Office, I discovered a Sum of 16,500,000 Million (sixteen Million five hundred thousand Pounds Sterling) in an account that Belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Business Mogul Mr. Moises Saba Masri Billionaire, a Jew from Mexico that was a victim of a helicopter crash 10 Jan, 2010, killing him and his family members . Saba was 46-years-old . Also in the chopper at the time of the crash was his wife, their son Avraham (Albert) and his daughter-in-law . The pilot was also dead .\n\nThe choice of contacting you is aroused from the geographical nature of where you live, particularly due to the sensitivity of the transaction and the confidentiality herein. Now our bank has been waiting for any of the relatives to come-up for the claim but nobody has done that. I personally have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives , I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin/Will Beneficiary to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at 16.5 Million Pounds can be paid to you .\n\nThis will be disbursed or shared in these percentages, 60% to me and 40% to you. I have secured all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up this claim we are making. All i need is to fill in your names to the documents and legalize it in the court here to prove you as the legitimate beneficiary. All I require now is your honest Co-operation, Confidentiality and Trust to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law .\n\nPlease, provide me the following, as we have 7 days to run it through. This is very URGENT PLEASE .\n\n1. Full Name:\n2. Your Direct Mobile Number:\n3. Your Contact Address:\n4. Occupation:\n5. Age:\n6. Sex:\n7. Nationality:\n\nHaving gone through a methodical search, I decided to contact you hoping that you will find this proposal interesting. Please on your confirmation of this message and indicating your interest, I will furnish you with more information.\nEndeavor to let me know your decision rather than keep me waiting .\n\nRegards,\nMr.Christopher Johnson\n+447017515810  \n'

S'\nFROM THE DESK OF MR LAMIDOLAMIDO SANUSISANUSI\nEXECUTIVE GOVERNOR, CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA (CBNCBN)\nOUR REF: CBNCBN/OHGOHG/OXDOXD1/2012\nYOUR REF:.................\nTELEX: CENBANKCENBANK.\nPAYMENT FILE: CBNCBN/BEN/010\n\n                 CBNCBN DEBT PAYMENT NOTICE OF YOUR FUNDS\n\nAttn: Beneficiary,\n\nMy name is Mr LamidoLamido SanusiSanusi  the Executive Governor Of The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBNCBN) and the Executive Chairman of "E.C.D.R".I discovered that your name and email address (in the Central Computer among the list of unpaid contractors, inheritance next of kin and lotto beneficiaries that was originated from Africa (Nigerian Government) Europe, Asia Plus Middle east, Americans) among the list of individuals and companies that your unpaid fund has been located to a suspense account.\n\nYour name appeared among the beneficiaries who will receive a part-payment of $10 million and has been approved already for Payment. Yesterday two foreigners (Mr. Tim Parker and Mr. Rowland Gulf) visited my office in your stead to inform me that they are your Representatives from United State, whom you send to collecting your Funds for you.\n\nWe in this Bank do not understand why you sent these men to come and Collect your Funds on your behalf. If actually you want them to help you Collect your Inheritance Bill Sum,at least you should have informed me as the Executive Governor of this Bank. They actually tendered some Vital Documents which proved that you actually sent them for the Collection of these Funds. Honestly, it really baffles me that you took such decision without my consent.\n\nHere are the Document which they tender to this Bank today:\n\n  1. LETTER OF ADMINISTRATION.\n 2. HIGH COURT INJUNCTION.\n 3. ORDER TO RELEASE.\n\nActually, these Documents which they tendered to this Noble Bank is a clear Proof that you sent them to Collect this Funds for you. Finally, I told them to come back tomorrow morning and they promised to come back. As the Governor of this Noble Bank, I was supposed to Release this Funds to them but I refused to do so because I wanted to hear from you first.\n\nDue to the Nature of my job, I will not want to make any mistake in Releasing this Funds to anyone except you whom is the Recognized BonafideBonafide Beneficiary to this Funds. Kindly clarify us on this issue before we make this Payment to these foreigners whom came on your behalf. In receipt of this confidential Letter, you are required to email this Bank immediately you receive this Confidential Letter.\n\nOFFICIALLY SIGNED.\nDR LAMIDOLAMIDO SANUSISANUSI.\nGOVERNOR CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA\ndrlamiolamido@hotmail.com\n'

S"\nYOUR URGENT REPLY SOON\nHello Dearest One,\n\nHow are you today, Please accept my sincere apologises if my email does not meet\nyour business or personal ethics, I really like to have a good relationship with\nyou, and I have a special reason why I decided to contact you because of the\nurgency of my situation here.\n\nPlease I write not only to introduce myself to you, but also tender a joint\ninvestment business proposal for your considerations and acceptance. I know that\nreceipt of my communication shall be a great surprise to you considering the\nfact that we did not know each other or had any business negotiations before\nnow, I am also aware of the fact that there is a lot of fraudulent business\nproposals circulating around the world, which makes it imperative for one to be\nextremely careful before accepting and venturing any business proposal from\nunfamiliar person like me.\n\nI however, pray your respected self not to allow the above unnatural\nabnormalities to influence your decision to accept my genuine proposal and\nintentions which undoubtedly would be of immense mutual benefits to both of us.\nI pledge to you for urgent and dedicated attention which this issue deserves.\n\nI deem it necessary to introduce myself in detail for you and the need for your\nassistance to claim and invest my inheritance for me, I am Miss. Isha Thomas D.\nVoer Hanson, 26years old girl from Liberia, the only daughter of Late National\nBank of Liberia Governor, Thomas Hanson who died on June 8, 2009 at the Delaware\nCounty Memorial Hospital in Upper Darby from a massive stroke. Meanwhile he had\nearlier undergone a kidney transplant in april 2009 at the university hospital\nof pennsylvania in philadelphia.\n\nI am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment I, am receiving from\nmy step mother. She planned to take away all my late father's treasury and\nproperties from me since the unexpected death of my beloved Father.\n\nMeanwhile I wanted to escape to the Europe but they hide away my international\npassport and other valuable traveling documents. Luckily they did not discover\nwhere I kept my Father's File which contains important documents. So I decided\nto run to the refugee camp where I am presently seeking asylum under the United\nNations High Commission for the Refugee here in Ouagadougou Republic of Burkina\nFaso. I wish to contact you personally for a long term business relationship and\ninvestment assistance in your country.\n\nMy father secretly deposited the sum of US$3,628, 000.00 in one of the prime\nbank with my name as the next of kin. However, I shall forward you with the\nnecessary information of the deposit on confirmation of your acceptance to\nassist me for the transfer and investment of the fund in your country. As you\nwill also help me in an investment, and I will like to complete my studies, as I\nwas in the school in Monrovia-Liberia, before the death of my father.\n\nIt is my intention to compensate you with 15% of the total money for your\nservices and the balance shall be my investment capital. This is the reason why\nI decided to contact you. Please all communications should be through this email\naddress only for confidential purposes. As soon as I receive your positive\nresponse showing your interest I will put things into action immediately. In the\nlight of the above, I shall appreciate an urgent message indicating your ability\nand willingness to handle this transaction sincerely.\n\nI am staying at the female hostel. Awaiting your urgent and positive response.\nPlease do keep this only to your self please I advice you not to disclose it to\na third party till I come over, once the fund has been transferred into your\naccount. I hope my explanation is very clear but if you need further\nclarification, then send in your questions.I will try to scan my picture to send\nin my next mail.\n\nThanks as I hope to receive from you soon.\n\nYours Sincerely\nMiss Isha Thomas D. Voer Hanson\n"
