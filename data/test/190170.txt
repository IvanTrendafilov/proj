Guidelines for posting in Surplus 419 Scam Letters forum

Subject Layout

To make it easy for everyone to find the type of scam they are looking for, please use this format for the Subject:Type of Scam - Sender's Location (if known from the IP Address)  
If the scam mail is particularly interesting/amusing, then a description of its noteworthiness could be added:Type of Scam - Reason for Particular Interest - Sender's Location  
If the 'type of scam' is not immediately obvious (lottery, loan, employment, pet scam, etc), these questions might help determine the best description:

1.  Who currently has the promised money?

A dying widow?  A soldier in Iraq?  A refugee?  A banker who has found some unclaimed funds?

2.  Why is the money being offered to you?

Compensation for being scammed?  Overdue contract payments?  Somebody needs help?

3.  Is there anything you need to do in return?

Stand in as next-of-kin?  Invest the money?  

4.  Is the writer offering friendship/a relationship and the IP address shows the mail was sent from either C&fnof;te d'Ivoire or Senegal?

If so, then this is probably a refugee.

Headers

Please include the full headers of the email.  Make certain that you have removed your own name and email address before posting, even if it is your baiting name/address.  If there is a 'to' email address which is not your own, please remove this too, unless you are certain it is the scammer's own email address.

See below for how to access headers in Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail.

Preventing Blowout

1.  Look for 'DKIM-Signature'.  Delete all that follows this down to 'DomainKey-Signature'.  This is not needed.  You can show it has been deleted by adding  or  or .

2.  Now delete from just after 'DomainKey-Signature' to just before 'Message ID'.  Again, you can note that you have deleted it.  

3.  Delete again from 'X-YMail-OSG' to the 'Received'. DKIM-Signature: 
DomainKey-Signature: 
Message-ID: <373957.57980.qm@web59501.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>
X-YMail-OSG: 
Received: from [41.222.192.69] by web59501.mail.ac4.yahoo.com via HTTP;

Note: this is the most usual layout.  Some headers will have a different order of DKIM-Signature, DomainKey-Signature, and X-YMail-OSG; and some will have one or more of these appearing twice.

4.  Alternatively: do not delete, but add a 'return' at the end of each line of the DKIM-Signature, DomainKey-Signature, and X-YMail-OSG in your 'post message' box.

5.  Use 'Preview' to check that all is well, and there is no right-scrolling of your browser window.

Finding the Headers

Gmail:

1.  Open the mail you wish to obtain the header for.
2.  At the top of the mail, on the right, next to the little box marked 'Reply', you will see a downwards pointing arrow.  Click it.
3.  Now choose 'Show Original'.

Yahoo:

1.  Go to Inbox.
2.  Click the RIGHT-mouse button on the 'subject' of the email.
3.  LEFT-click on the bottom option of the menu: 'View Full Headers'.

Or, in the older version of Yahoo:

1.  Go to Inbox and open one of the emails you would like the headers for, as if you are going to read it.
2.  Go to the bottom of the mail.  On the bottom-right is a link, 'Full Headers' - left-click on that.

Hotmail:

1.  Open the email as if you are going to read it.
2.  On the right, just under the date, is the word 'Actions'.  Click on it.
3.  Click on the second-from-the-bottom menu option - 'View message source'.
