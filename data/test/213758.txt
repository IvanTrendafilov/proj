Hello Dear,

Compliments of the season. My name is Mr.Greg Thompson;
I am the Head, Internal Affairs of ARB APEX BANK, a financial
Institution situated in the Upper East Region of Ghana in West
Africa.

Our Establishment is a community Oriented Facility that helps the
rural area(s) in development and Financial Services. It is my wish to
intimate you on a transaction that will be of mutual benefit if we can
work together to achieve success.

I do not want any form of betrayal or problems but I just hope you can assist me.
I will state here that it is with good faith that I write you this letter bearing
in mind the nature of its content coming from a person without any
referral whatsoever, but please read and digest its content and
objectively consider if we can work towards a goal.

In 2001, a contract was awarded by the World Health Organization (WHO) to a
Foreign Construction company to develop a number of cottage hospitals.
The capital meant for this project was deposited in my bank as it was
the only financial institution in that locality.

With my position, I traded with part of the money in the Stock Market and made
a profit of an amount tewenty two million, Eight Hundred & Fifty
Thousand US Dollars ($22.850, 000.00).

The Initial money I returned to the owners and my profit I deposited
in an Escrow call account and I did not declare this fact to my board
of directors. I drew up a draft that made the money seem to be held in
Trust by my Bank pending the notification of a referee and a
beneficiary. I contacted you, to stand as beneficiary of this Account
because as a member of the Administrative Board of this Bank, I cannot
be associated with this money.

I can transfer this money to your Account following the due process
regarding international Transfers of this kind. What I ask of you is
that can I rely on your trust? Can you hold this money in Trust for me
till I arrive in your Country?

If you can guarantee this to me then I am ready to give you 25% of the
amount. Do please write to me using my personal Email:gregthompson1234@hotmail.com

If you do not accept, please forget I contacted you.
Best Regards and God bless.
Mr.Greg Thompson.
