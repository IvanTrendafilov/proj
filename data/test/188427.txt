The specific scams fora have scams sorted by type, making it easy for you to find scammers running a particular type of scam.

Please be aware that ScamWarners is not a baiting site so baits shouldn't be discussed on the forum there.  Please do, however, consider posting scammer scripts at ScamWarners while you're posting them here in Surplus.  Surplus is purged regularly so that baiters have a fresh source of scammers to bait.  The posts at ScamWarners remain so that the information will show up in searches for potential victims.

There is information on how baiters can most effectively contribute at ScamWarners, here: Welcome Scambaiters
You can also ask any of the moderators there for help.
