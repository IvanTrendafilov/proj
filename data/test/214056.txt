Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1  Quote:   Hello Dear,

Life is gradually passing away from me as a result of my present medical condition and my personal doctor confided in me yesterday that i have only but few more days to live. In view of this setback, i want to donate my estate for humanitarian assistance since this has always been the plan of my late husband and besides i have no child.

In an effort to compliment the good work of God almighty and the wish of my late Husband i donate the sum of $2,500,000.00 USD ( TWO Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars USD) to you. On your acknowledgment of this mail and informing me of your nationality and current place of resident, my lawyer will facilitate due processes for transfer of this legacy to you.

May Allah bless you as you use this money judiciously for the work of charity.

Regards,

Mrs. Kameela Sakeena Yasir
