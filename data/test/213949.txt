Attn : Beneficiary
I'm Mrs Angela Brown of Tampa, FL 33629.But reside In New York for
Now, I'm a US citizen, I'm 51yrs old. I'm one of those that took part in the
inheritance/Compensation in Nigeria many years ago and they refused
to pay me, I had paid over $78,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment all to no
avail.
So I decided to travel down to Nigeria with all my compensation
documents, so i was directed to meet Rev.Terry Tunde, who is the member of
COMPENSATION AWARD AUTHORITY and a Human Rights Activist ,
and I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us
through emails are fake.
He took me to the paying bank for the claim of my compensation
payment. Right now I'm the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my
compensation funds amounting to $11,000,000.00 Moreover,Rev.Terry Tunde
, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their
payments and I saw your email as one of the scam victims, that is
why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your
fund, they are only making money out of you. I will advise you to
contact Rev.Terry Tunde.you have to contact him directly on this information below.
COMPENSATION AWARD AUTHORITY
Name : Rev.Terry Tunde(Rev.Father)
Email:Telephone number- +234-8031879819

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are
contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them,
they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.
The only money I paid after I met Rev.Terry Tunde was just $590usd
for the paper works which according to him is compulsory, take note of that.
Thank You and Be Blessed.

Angela Brown
