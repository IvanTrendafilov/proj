 The Google Corporation has discovered a huge number of double claims due to winners informing close friends relatives and third parties about their winning and also sharing their pin numbers. As a result of this, these friends try to claim the lottery on behalf of the real winners. The Google Corporations has reached a decision from headquarters that any double claim discovered by the Lottery Board will result to the canceling of that particular winning, making a loss for both the double claimer and the real winner, as it is taken that the real winner was the informer to the double claimer about the lottery.So you are hereby strongly advised once more to keep your winnings strictly confidential until you claim your prize.

 Congratulations from the Staffs & Members of the Google Interactive Lotteries Board Commission.

 Yours Sincerely,
Sergey Brin.
2011 Google Corporation.
