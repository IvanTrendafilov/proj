MY HEART CHOOSE TO BLESS YOU. 

Dear Beloved, 
i am Mrs. Lora Nazar and i have been suffering from ovarian cancer disease=
and the doctor ays that i have just two days to leave. i am from (eastern=
Province) Russian but base in Africa Burkina Faso since eight years ago as=
a business woman dealing with gold exportation. Now that i am about to end=
the race like this, without any family members and no child. i have $3=
Million US Dollars in Africa Development Bank (ADB) Burkina Faso which i=
instructed the bank to give St Andrews Missionary Home in Burkina Faso . 

But my mind is not at rest because i am writing this letter now through the=
help of my computer beside my sick bed. i also have $4.5Million US Dollars=
at Ecobank here in Burkina Faso and I instructed the bank to transfer the=
money to the foreigner that will apply to the bank after i have gone that=
they should release the fund to you, but you will assure me that you will=
take 50% of the money and give 50% to the motherless baby homes, charity=
homes. In your country for my heart to rest. You are to contact the bank=
through this email address: (eco.b-bf@blumail.org) yours fairly friend 

Thanks from 
Madam Lora Nazar.
