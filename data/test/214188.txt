International Commercial Bank Ghana 
First Light Branch Accra,Ghana. 
Tell: 00233242761062. 

Hello Dear, 
I got your contact during my search for a reliable, trust worthy and honest person to introduce this transfer project with. My name is Tony Adoo.                                                     
I am the manager of the International Commercial Bank Ghana, First Light Branch Accra. I am a Ghanaian married with two kids. 

I am writing to solicit your assistance in the noble transfer of US$15.500.000.00. This fund is the excess of what my branch in which I am the manager made as profit during the last year. I have already submitted an approved End of the last Year financial report for the year 2010 to my Head Office here in Accra and they will never know of this Excess. I have since then, placed this amount of US$15.500.000.00 (Fifteen Million Five hundred Thousand United States Dollars) on a SUSPENSE ACCOUNT without a beneficiary. 

As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this money thus I am impelled to request for your assistance to receive this money into your bank account. I intend to part 30% of this fund to you while 70% shall be for me. I do need to stress that there are practically no risk involved in this. 

It is going to be a bank-to-bank transfer to your nominated bank account anywhere you feel safer. 

All I need from you is to stand as the original depositor of this fund. 
If you accept this offer, I will appreciate your timely response Please call me on the number above when you reply me. with this email id tonyadoo22@gmail.com

With regards, 
Tony Adoo.
