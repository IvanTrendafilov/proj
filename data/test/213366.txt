  Quote:   Dear Friend,

I hope this mail gets to you in the best frame of mind. I am sorry if I am intruding into your privacy by contacting you through this means, since we do not know each other physically.  I actually got your email from your country's web-directory and I decided the best thing to do is contact you and tell you my story; I do hope you listen with your heart as you read through my "Letter". The fact is that I have been directed by the spirit of humanity to you hoping you will be fair enough to respond to this task that I shall be putting forward to you. As you rightly know, our today's world is governed by greed, wickedness, hostility and hatred. People no longer feel safe dealing with close friends, relatives, neighbors and loved ones and trust are often betrayed by people you least expected.

I am sorry for not introducing myself to you before now. I am Joanne Crawford from the U.S.A but now undergoing medical treatment in doctor's hospital Bahamas. I worked with the Saudi Aramcos for 30Years in Saudi Arabia for over a decade I married for 40 years without a child. My Husband left Millions, Properties and Companies with me. He died after a brief illness that lasted for two weeks. I do not fancy racial discrimination and am not a religious fanatic so if you are one of those that thinks his or her religion or race is superior to that of other persons; please do me the favor of not replying this mail. I have spent 72 good years in this world and have witness the beautiful and ugly sides of life. I have learnt not to view life from one perspective because life itself is very unpredictable. My reason for contacting you is to combine our ideas and dedication to touch the lives of the less-privilege in some part of the world so that a good name and legacy would be left a
fter our time on earth.

I am actually in the hospital sending this mail to you as I have experienced one trauma after the other. Medical experts have informed me I might never live to survive this ailment that has plagued the last few
years of my life. This is because this deadly ailment has affected my vital organs. Somehow, since the doctor had confirmed my situation that I will not live long I have decided to give out my money to the poor. Deposited the sum of ?125,000,000.00 (One Hundred and Twenty Five Million Great British Pounds Sterling) with my Bank. Presently, this money is still there. I now feel safer dealing with strangers than people I know due to constant betrayals I have received from loved ones. Nowadays, only few people think about assisting orphanage homes and other charity organizations around the world due to self-centeredness. The rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor. Please respond to this mail as
soon as you finish reading to let me know your opinion about assisting the less-privilege and if you have given it a thought to help them one way or the other. I have a dream to share with you and I hope and pray I am communicating with the right person.

With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank. I will also issue them a letter of authority and change of ownership certificate that will empower you as the
original beneficiary of this fund, through my Lawyer. I want you to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Whosoever that wants to serve the Almighty must serve him with
all his heart and mind and soul and also in truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for an individual for this same purpose. Please assure
me that you will act according to my specification here in. Hoping to hear from you soonest.

Thank you and May the Almighty God bless you.

Regards,
Mrs. Joanne Elizabeth Crawford.
