Sir/Ma,my name is Maxwell Salim and I'm from Liberia in West Africa but I resides here in United Kingdom. I have a friend whose father is the  king of their community and he told me he has the crown of his dad made of gold for sale and It weigh 10kg and he is ready to sell a kilo at the rate of  15,000USD but right now we are looking for a buyer of the crown. Please the buyer should have it in mind that there is no document to be sign here or any upfront payment to be paid . Payment is made after the crown of gold is been assayed to avoid misconceptions. I will be waiting for your prompt response . Thanks. Mr Maxwell Salim
