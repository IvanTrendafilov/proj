investigation on behalf of National City Bank, Nigeria, and we will like
you to assist with this Independent enquiry. My name is Edward Ashante.
I am a Private Investigator and also a reunion counselor/analyst
This investigation and enquiry involves a client who shares the same
surname with you and also the circumstances surrounding the investments
made by this client at National City Bank, Lagos - Nigeria.

The client and his family died in a plane-crash and no successor in
title over the investments made here in Lagos - Nigeria.

The essence of this communication with you is to request you provide us
information/comments on any or all of the three issues below:

1-Are you aware of any relative/relation who shares your same surname
whos last known contact address was Lagos Nigeria?

2-Are you aware of any investment of considerable value in capital
market and money market made by such a person at National City Bank.

3-Can you establish beyond reasonable doubt your eligibility to assume
status of successor in title to the deceased?

It is pertinent that you inform us ASAP whether or not you are familiar
with this personality that we may put an end to this communication and

We are sorry for being constrained in providing you with more detailed
