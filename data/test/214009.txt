CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA.

 ATTENTION: BENEFICIARY,

HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY,FOLLOWING THE SERIES IF PETITIONS FROM SOME BENEFICIARIES OVER NON-PAYMENT OF OVER-DUE CONTRACTS/INHERITANCE, WE WERE DIRECTED TO CARRY OUT A THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE VARIOUS ISSUES RAISED IN THE PETITIONS WITH A VIEW TO EFFECTING PAYMENT IMMEDIATELY.

TO SHOW ITS SERIOUSNESS ON THE ISSUE, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SET ASIDE US$34 BILLION FOR PAYMENTS TO "CATEGORIZED BENEFICIARIES". GOING THROUGH THE RECORDS, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT SOME OF THE CLAIMS WERE INDEED FAKE AS THERE WAS NO TRACE OF ANY CONTRACT EXECUTED ANYWHERE IN NIGERIA WHILE IN SOME OTHER CASES, PAYMENTS WERE MADE TO WRONG BENEFICIARIES.

WELL KNOWN TO ALL, THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA IS THE MOTHER BANK OF ALL COMMERCIAL BANKS HERE IN NIGERIA. THIS MORNING AT ABOUT (10:15AM STANDARD PACIFIC TIME), I WAS ALERTED BY MY SECRETARY THAT TWO MEN WERE AT MY OFFICE RECEPTION WAITING TO SEE ME AND SO I TOLD MY SECRETARY TO LET THEM IN. TO MY SURPRISE THEY WERE ONE MR. LEONARDO REYES OF SINGAPORE AND ONE NIGERIAN ATTORNEY BY NAME (BARRISTER. CHIBUZOR EMERE). REALLY THESE MEN WERE UNEXPECTED BY ME BECAUSE THEIR VISIT WAS IMPROMPTED. I HAD TO ASK THEM WHY THEY CAME TO SEE ME IN PERSON AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE HERE TO COLLECT THE INHERITANCE/CONTRACT FUND WHICH RIGHTFULLY BELONGS TO YOU, ON YOUR BEHALF.

 HOWEVER, WE DISCOVERED THAT YOUR TRANSACTION IS ONE OF THE FEW OVER-DUE PAYMENTS, THOUGH WITH SOME IRREGULARITIES THAT DEMANDS IMMEDIATE CLARIFICATION FROM YOU AS AN APPLICATION FOR CHANGING OF BENEFICIARY HAS BEEN RECEIVED IN THIS OFFICE THROUGH THIS TWO GENTLE MEN DUE TO YOUR CRITICAL ILLNESS.

 PLEASE CLARIFY THE FOLLOWING:

DID YOU BROKER THE DEBT TO ONE MR. LEONARDO REYES OF A ONE STOP LOGISTICS PROVIDED PTE LTD, SINGAPORE, TO CLAIM AND RECEIVE THE PART PAYMENT AMOUNTED SUM OF $4.7M ON YOUR BEHALF?

DID YOU SIGN ANY "DEED OF ASSIGNMENT" IN HIS FAVOUR, THEREBY MAKING HIM THE CURRENT BENEFICIARY? (STAMP AGREEMENT WITH US).

 BY THE ALLEGED "TRANSACTION" BETWEEN YOU AND MR. LEONARDO REYES, IS IT IN AGREEMENT BETWEEN BOTH OF YOU THAT THE PAYMENT SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO:

 BANK: OCBC BANK (OVERSEA-CHINESE BANKING CORPORATION LTD)
BANK ADDRESS: TOA PAYOH CENTRAL BRANCH
520 TOA PAYOH, LORONG 6
#02-53 SINGAPORE 310520
SWIFT CODE: OCBCSGSG
ACCT. NO: 568-002323-201
BENEFICIARY: A ONE STOP LOGISTICS PROVIDED PTE LTD.

 OUR SUSPENSION ARISES FROM THE SWIFTNESS WITH WHICH THE PROCESS OF TRANSFERRING THE BENEFICIARY FROM YOU TO LEONARDO REYES & CO., WAS HASTILY FACILITATED BY TOP OFFICIALS IN THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA.

 PLEASE CONFIRM TO US THE GENUINENESS OR OTHERWISE OF THE ABOVE CLAIM TO ENABLE US ACT ON THE PAYMENT,AS ALL BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR THE RELEASE OF THE FUND HAVE BEEN SATISFIED.

UPON THE RECEIPT OF YOUR REPLY ENDEAVOR TO CONFIRM YOUR CURRENT VALID INFORMATION SUCH AS YOUR NAME, ADDRESS, TELEPHONE, BANKING DETAILS, AND COPY OF YOUR IDENTITY TO AVOID ANY FOR OF COMPLICATION.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE BOUND TO RECOGNIZE MR. LEONARDO`S CLAIM TO THIS PAYMENT IF YOU FAIL TO PROMPTLY RESPOND TO THIS INQUIRY. WHILE WAITING FOR YOUR URGENT CONFIRMATION VIA THIS .

 YOURS FAITHFULLY,
