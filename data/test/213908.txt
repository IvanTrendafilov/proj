THE
GUILDLINES
AND
INSTRUCTIONS

The Federal bureau of investigation (FBI) Washington, DC in Conjunction
with some other relevant Investigation Agencies here in The United states
of America have recently been informed through our Global intelligence
monitoring network that you presently have a Transaction going on with
Citi bank of Nigeria as regards to your over-due contract payment which
was fully endorsed in your favor accordingly.

It might interest you to know that we have taken out time in screening
through this project as stipulated on our protocol of operation and have
finally confirmed that your contract payment is 100% genuine and hitch
free from all fact and of which you have the lawful right to claim your
fund without any further delay.

Having said all these, we will further advise you to go ahead in dealing
with the Citi bank office accordingly, as we will be monitoring all their
services with you as well as your correspondence at all level. In
addendum, also be informed that we recently had a meeting with the
Managing Director of the Citi bank of Nigeria, in the person of Mr. John
Edward along with some of the top officials of the Ministry regarding
your case and they made us to understand that your file has been held in
base pending on when you personally come for the claims. They also told
us that the only problem they are facing right now is that some
unscrupulous element are using this project as an avenue to scam innocent
people off their hard earned money by impersonating the managing director
and the Citi Bank office.


We were also made to understand that a lady with name Mrs. Joan C.Bailey
from OHIO has already contacted them and also presented to them all the
necessary documentations evidencing your claim purported to have been
signed personally by you prior to the release of your Contract fund
valued at  US$5,000,000.00 (Five Million United States Dollars) but the
Citi Bank office did the wise thing by insisting on hearing from you
personally before they proceed the wiring of your fund to the Bank
information which was forwarded to them by the above named Lady so that
was the main reason  they contacted the F.B.I so as to make
investigations on the payment .

They further informed us that we should warn citizens of this great
nation and law abiding citizens of other nations whom must have been
informed of the contract payment which was awarded to them from the Citi
Bank to be very careful prior to these irregularities so that they don't
fall victim to this ugly circumstance. And should in case you are already
dealing with anybody or office claiming to be from the Citi bank, you are
further advised to STOP further contact with them in your best interest
and then contact immediately the real office of the paying bank Citi bank
only with the below informations accordingly :
