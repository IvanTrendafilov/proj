How are you?Am here to inform you that your friend paid us to kill you...So your life is really needed to kill..My boys are really watching all the full step you make..They really want to kill you....but i see you as a nice person Since last week we started watching you.....you deserve to live longer..that why am informing you..but i don't want you to inform the police because We will kill you before you get there.So all i need you to do now is to co-operate with me and your life will be save...And if you corporate with me i will send you the full details and pictures of your friend that ask us to kill you....i need the sum of $5,000usd.....to save your life. so know delay..because delay is dangerous....

1). SO WILL YOU CO-OPERATE WITH ME OR NOT?
2). WILL YOU PAY THE MONEY OR NOT?

Awaiting your respond.Remember i dont delay in my mission....
No delay.
