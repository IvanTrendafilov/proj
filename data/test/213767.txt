Dear Sir,

I am Frank Brown the Manager, Bills And Exchange at the Foreign Remittance Department in
a Bank... Actually, I have a very urgent & confidential Business Proposition for you & for our
veral mutual interest.On the 6th of March 2001,our Customer, an American National,Late
Douglas J Stone, an Oil Merchant / Contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria,
deposited, a valued amount of US$32Million in my branch.Upon maturity, I sent a routine
notification to his forwarded address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder, &
finally we discovered from his contract employers NNPC, that Late Douglas J Stone,until his
death Eight ( 8 ) years ago in a ghastly terrorist attack to American Airline flight 175
from Boston to Los Angeles,crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center (WTC) with
86 people on board. All occupants of the Aeroplane unfortunately lost their lives.
On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace
his Next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that
late Douglas J Stone , did not declare any Next of kin in all his official documents.

This sum US$32Million is still floating in the bank and the interest is being rolled over with
the principal sum at the end of each year. No one came forward to claim it. According to
Nigeria Laws, at the expiration of 10years,the money will revert to the Ownership of the
Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Consequently,my proposal is that i
willl like you as a foreigner to stand in as a Next of kin of Late Douglas J Stone. This is
simple. All I require is your honest and co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I
guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you
from a breach of the law. I will want you to send to me on your return emais the following
information for the transfer in your favor

1. Your Full Name............................................
2.. Your contact address................................
3. Your Tel/Fax Numbers:.............................

Let's consider that our ratio of sharing will be as stated Thus
1. I as the originator of the Fund will take 50% of the transferable
2.You as the Manager of the Fund will take 50% of the transferable Fund.
Most importantly, CONFIDENTIALITY as what I saw as the life wire to the success of the
transfer of this Fund must have to be emulated between you and me. You have to use this
media to promise me that you will no in anyway expose the content of this transaction to
anybody be it your Friends, Colleagues and Co-Workers.I will also want you to send your
reply to this email as soon as you get this mail to enable us discuss
on the modalities and processes for success of this transaction. Thanks for your anticipated
cooperation and understanding.

I wait for your kind response.

Frank Brown.
