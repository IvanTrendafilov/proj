Attention,

How are you and your family? I hope fine, my urgent need for a foreign partner
has made me contact you for your assistance. I am a banker by profession in
Kingdom of Cambodia and currently holding the post of Director Auditing and
Accounting unit of my bank. I have the opportunity of transferring the left
over funds ($18.2 million) of one of our bank clients who died in a car crash
since seven years ago and none of his family member or relation has come for
the claim, and now the bank is planning how to confiscate the funds since no
one has come for the claim. Please I need your total honesty to execute this
transaction under your kind control for the benefit of us both.

Hence, I will offer you 40% of the amount mentioned above and if you are sure
you are capable of handling this transaction and ready to assist me in
executing this business, further details of the transfer will be forwarded to
you as soon as I receive your return mail, have a great day.

For more clarification reply me back and please note that the funds claims is
100% risk free. If you are ready to do this with me, kindly contact me on my
private email address ( prakphorn6819@ovi.com ) for more details.

Thanks.
Prak Phorn
