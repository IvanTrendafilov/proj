Greetings,
I am Mr. Steven Edwards  the former financial manager of SNS BANK in Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS. 
There is a bonded account belonging to a Late Family Member and  I sincerely intend to discuss with you about it. 
It has some form of relationship with you sharing similarity in name. 
I am in Scotland at the moment studying a course, kindly email me back immediately regarding this issue. 
You can give me your personal phone number so that i can reach you via telephone because it's urgent .
Regards, 
Steven Edwards.
