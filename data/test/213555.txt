  Hi,


I am Larry Johnson Director Inspection Unit United Nations
Inspection Agent in Hartsfield International Airport Atlanta
Georgia.During our investigation, 

I discovered An abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom
under iship forwarder which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to
our facility here in Atlanta and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed
sum of money in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately 110kg each. 


The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly
declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as
personal effect to avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent also the
Diplomat inability to pay for Non Inspection Fees.




On my assumption, each of the boxes will contain more that $4M or above
in each and the consignment is still left in storage house till today
through a registered shipping Company, Courier Dispatch Service Limited a
division of Tran guard LTD. 


The Consignment are two metal box with weight of about 110kg each
(Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm). Effective capacity: 680
L.)Approximately,




The details of the consignment including your name the official document
from United Nation office in London are tagged on the Metal Trunk
box.






If you want us to transact the delivery for mutual benefit, you should
provide your Phone Number, full address, to cross check if it corresponds
with the address on the official document including the name of nearest
Airport around you and other details. 


You should send the required details to me for onward delivery.





All communication must be held extremely confidential. I can get
everything concluded within 24 to 48 hours upon your acceptance and
proceed to your address for delivery. 


But it must be on the condition that you will give me 50% of the amount
contained in the boxes and i must get assurance from you concerning my
50% before i will proceed.



I want us to transact this business and share the money, since the
shipper have abandoned it and ran away.


I will pay for the Non inspection fee and arrange for the boxes to be
moved out of this Airport to your address, Once we are through i will
deploy the services of a secured shipping Company geared to provide the
security it needs to your doorstep. 


or i can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble. But i will share
it 50% to you and 50% to me. 


But you have to assure me of my 50%. do respond to my through my direct
email: larryjohnsonus@gmail.com





Best Regards,

Larry Johnson
