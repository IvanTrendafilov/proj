FROM THE DESKTOP

OF MR LARRY WILLIAM

ZENITH BANK PLC.



I am a personal accountant to Late Engineer Michael, a citizen of your country , who
used to work with French oil major total, company here in. Herein, shall be referred
to as my client. On the 21st of April 2004, Mr. Michael, his wife and his three
children were involved in a drastic car accident along Sagamu/Lagos Express Road.
Unfortunately he and his three kids lost their lives immediately in the event of the
accident, while the wife was taken to the hospital where she died three days later.
Their bodies were kept in the mortuary for five months, in order for the authority,
to carry out a proper investigation on how to locate their surviving relatives. They
have checked all available public files and embassies, but all their efforts had
proved abortive, as they could not found any of their relatives.



After these several unsuccessful attempts, no one has been coming for his account
that he deposited with my bank (Zenith Bank Plc). And due to the banking law and
regulation of 1985, sub section 18d page 103 chapter 11 of constitution governing
all banking policy, and in accordance to the banking decree 003 sub section 45 which
stated that any deposited fund which remains unclaimed after the existing period of
four years will be confiscated by the national treasury department as unclaimed
fund. And this has brought too much agitation in our bank between boards of
directors on how to declare this account unserviceable, base on the fact that the
deceased has no next of kin. After the meeting held by the executives of zenith bank
with the personal attorney to late Michael on 15th of November 2010, they have all
agreed to extend the date to 27th of January 2012.



Consequently to this, I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and
property left behind by my client before the national treasury department gets them
confiscated or declare unserviceable by zenith bank Plc Where the deceased have an
account Valued at about fifteen Million, three hundred and forty five thousand U.S
dollars (USD 15, 345,000.00). The bank has issued out a notice to provide the next
of kin or have the account confiscated with in the next few days. Since no one has
been able to locate their relatives for over four years now, I seek your consent to
present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that this account valued at
fifteen Million, three hundred and forty five thousand U.S dollars (USD 15,
345,000.00) can be paid to you and then you and I Can share the money. All the
necessary documents concerning this claim are with the Bank legal department. All I
require is your honest cooperation to enable us seal this deal.



Get back to me for immediate commencement of this deal.



Yours Truly,



Mr. Larry
