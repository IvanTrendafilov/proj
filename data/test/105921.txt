This is not because "it spoils our fun" - if it was a case of spoiling some baits to save naive scam victims then I would want to close them as well.  Rather, it is the considered judgement of dozens of experienced scam-fighters who are dedicated to hurting scammers' operations (closing their websites, getting them arrested, warning off their victims, etc).

Everyone is free to continue responding to 419 in whatever way s/he chooses. However, we ask that no one should use the Surplus Letters forum on our board as a source of lad accounts for closure. The Surplus Letters forum is a resource set up for people to fight 419 in the ways that board members agree with - please do not abuse it by using in ways that we do not approve of.

If you want to close accounts, please find another board or join the Phone Lads forum here.  Closing Phone Lad accounts is definitely the right thing to do.  The only other exception that we make are "vanity accounts" such as manager@verybigbank.com - these cost the scammer ~$45 to set up, so closing them is also encouraged.
