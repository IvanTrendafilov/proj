Read attached for detail and get back to me as quickly as possible  
Attached S HAMZW.HTM reads:Dear Sir,

My name is Steve Hamza direct KTT Wire transfer. i know you do not know me before but after a serious thought, I decided to reach you personally after this Christmas because I do not have anything against you, but your so called partners. I am the director of wire transfer/telex department FOREIGN AFFAIRS with (OAU) and ALL NIGERIA FOREIGN PAYMENT via wire transfer in collaboration with World Bank regards to debt payment.

Sometime ago your so called partner approached me through a friend of mine and requested that I assist him to conclude a money transfer deal with you as the beneficiary. According to him, he wanted us to use this strategy to transfer a huge amount of us dollars by registering you as a beneficiary that is about to be paid as contractor / inheritance. We agreed that once I did that, he will give me 40% of the total fund, 30% for YOU and 30% for himself. Having agreed on that i went ahead and programmed your name on the payment computer as the beneficiary, after doing that, your so called partners started playing pranks with me trying to double cross me because they know that i did not have any legal charges against them, but they refused to understand that the money was still on the way and had not hit your account.

Because of that i placed a stop order, call back the money and deleted your payment (CODE) from the system, which made it impossible for you to receive the payment no-matter what you try.  I am aware that they have been bribing some officials to get another approval to enable them transfer the money to you but all efforts were to no success. Rather they keep demanding non existing fees from you. Is it not funny that a beneficiary is being asked to pay for approval while his fund is here with us? Well, This is the real cause for the delay.

I GOT INFORMATION THAT THEY ARE TELLING YOU THAT YOUR MONEY IS IN OFFSHORE BANK ACCOUNT, BEAR IN MIND YOUR PAYMENT IS NOT IN ANY OFFSHORE, YOU WILL NEVER RECEIVE YOUR PAYMENT FROM ANY OFFSHORE CENTERS AS FOLLOWS (1) LONDON, SPAIN, HOLLAND, DUBAI BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY TOLD YOU, OR TELLING YOU THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE THE MONEY VIA CONSIGNMENT (BOXES) WHICH NEVER EXIST IN ANY BANKING/TRANSFER TERM GLOBALLY.

Now if you want us to work together, these are my conditions.

(I) I will have 50% of the money and 50% for you because it is only two of us and you must keep off from every other person and keep it highly confidential and secret.

(ii) You MUST assure me that you will not betray me at last and my own share will be wired into the account I will provide or keep safe until when I arrive in your country for the sharing.

(iii) We can conclude the transaction with utmost SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL if you agree to adhere to my directives based on these conditions being acceptable by you, contact me immediately to enable us finalize all the arrangement.

As soon as we agreed, i will procure the necessary approvals on your behalf also update your fill to have a smooth transfer both now and after the money have got into your account.

If you do not agreed with my condition, i will advice you to forget about the funds because there is no way you can conclude the transfer without my help, rather you will keep being deceived by impostors and being asked for more non existing fees.

Get back to me through my private email: mrstevehamzacbn1@globomail.com also makes sure you call me on my direct Tel No: +234-81-69665438

Best Regards.
