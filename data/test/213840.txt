Attn: Dear Good Friend,

I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of Sixty Two Million Nine Hundred and Fifty Thousand British Pounds Sterling (62,950,000.00) to your account.

The fund has been dormant (in-active) for 7 years in our Bank here without anybody coming for it. I want to release the fund to you as the nearest person to our deceased customer (the owner of the account) who died along after a brief Illness in London. The Bank will release the fund to you as the nearest person to the deceased customer. For more information about the deceased customer you can visit this site:

This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential. I am sure and have confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute a project of this great magnitude. I solicit your assistance to enable us transfer the said amount into your safe account for onward investment. You can either provide me with an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank account immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business, trusting in you and believing in God that you will never let me down in future when the funds will transferred into your account.

The owner of this account is a foreigner and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his company. My investigation through the National immigration department and Ministries here proved to me as well that he was single during his first visit in UK. As a matter of fact, I have decided to transfer this fund abroad for investment plan.
