From Mrs. Beatriz Yusi,

My name is Mrs.Beatriz Yusi, The wife of Albert Yusi who was 
coordinator of
Bayan Muna for Misamis Oriental and Chairman of MOFA. He was gunned 
down
and killed in our home in the Philippine on July 20th, 2008.

Before my late husband was killed, I inherited from his estate a total 
sum
of ($ 9.5 Million Dollars) Nine Million five Hundred Thousand Dollars 
Which
was made from the last cocoa business import we made together, this 
money
which my late husband put in a metallic trunk box and deposited it in a
security and finance company ABROAD. This deposit was coded under a 
secret
arrangement as a family treasure.

I am contacting you because I want you to help me in retrive this fund 
to
your account for the future of our children.I hope to trust you as who 
will
not sit on this money when you claim it.i made up my mind to give you 
15 %
of the total money for your help after the money has been transfer to 
your
account.Hopping to hear from you.

Mrs. Beatriz Yusi.
