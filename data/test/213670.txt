You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.


The only money I paid after I meet Reverend. Anderson was just $85 Usd for the paper works, take note of that. Once again stop contacting those people, I will advise you to contact Reverend. Anderson so that he can help you to Transfer your Fund into your account, instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.


Thank You and Be Blessed.


Mrs. Anna Joy.
