I have decided to give arms to the needing in the societies. I want this to be a legacy laid down by me on earth therefore I decided to build charity organizations for the less privilege now that my health has deteriorated so badly. I cannot do it personally due to my ailment that is while am soliciting your kind assistant to make this dream a reality through you. I have intend to donate the sum of $10.6M USD I deposited in (OVERSEA CREDIT COMMISSION) for investment abroad to help the less privileged. I need you to help me claim these funds where it was deposited to build charity organizations for the less privilege in the society.

Please I will appreciate if you indicate interest to help actualize this dream and also include your contact telephone/fax numbers that I will forward to the (COMMISSION OFFICIALS) for onward communication with you as my appointed beneficiary.
