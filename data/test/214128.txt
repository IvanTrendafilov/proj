Let me start by introducing myself. I am Ahmed Al Ansari, the Branch Manager of National Bank of Abu Dhabi. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. An American Iraqi Foreign Oil Consultant /Contractor with the Chevron Petroleum Corporation Company named Late Mr. Thomas Stone made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$12,000,000.00 (Twelve Million) United State Dollars in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract an employer that is the Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant confirmed to us that he was actually dead.

Before the time of his death, he had on a visit to my branch office confided in me that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. Therefore, Twelve million United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. It is against this backdrop that my suggestion that I would like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Thomas Stone so that you will be able to receive his funds for our mutual benefit. We will share the fund at the ration of 60% for me while 40 % for you.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please kindly reply to this email immediately. Upon receiving your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Also I wish for you to please observe utmost confidentiality over this proposition, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us at the end, provided we both work hand in hand to achieve success.

Your earliest response to this email would be greatly appreciated. Reply here with this E-mail: ahmed.al7661@gmail.com

Regards,

Ahmed Al Ansari.
