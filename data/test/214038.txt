
Dear Beloved,

I am Mrs. Alisa Losif and i have been suffering from ovarian cancer disease and the doctor says that i have just more two days to live. i am from (eastern Province) Russian but base in Africa Burkina Faso since eight years ago as a business woman dealing with gold exportation. 

Now that i am about to end the race like this, without any family members and no child. i have $3Million US Dollars in Africa Development Bank (ADB) Burkina Faso which i instructed the bank to give it to St Andrews Missionary Home in Burkina Faso . 

But my mind is not at rest because i am writing this letter now through the help of my computer beside my sick bed. i also have $4.5Million US Dollars at Ecobank here in Burkina Faso and i instructed the bank to transfer the money to the foreigner that will apply to the bank after i have gone that they should release the fund to you, but you will assure me that you will take 50% of the money and give 50% to the motherlessbabyhomes, charity homes. In your country for my heart to rest. YOU HAVE TO CONTACT THE BANK THROUGH THIS EMAIL ADDRESS: (ecobankbfaso@umail.net) 

Yours fairly friend 
Thanks from
Madam Alisa Losif
