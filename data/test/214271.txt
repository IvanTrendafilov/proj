James Brown,
INSPECTION UNIT
Chicago O'Hare International Airport
Address:10000 West O'Hare, Chicago, IL, 60666.
Hi,

I am James Brown Director Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agent in O'Hare International Airport.During our investigation, I discovered An abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom underiship forwarder which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in Chicago and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately 110kg each. The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent also the Diplomat inability to pay for Non Inspection Fees.

On my assumption, each of the boxes will contain more that $6M or above in each and the consignment is still left in storage house till today through a registered shipping Company, The Consignment are two metal box with weight of about 110kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm). Effective capacity: 680 L.)Approximately.

The details of the consignment including your name the official document from United Nation office in London are tagged on the Metal Trunk box.

If you want us to transact the delivery for mutual benefit, you should provide your Phone Number, full address, to cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official document including the name of nearest Airport around you and other details. You should send the required details to me for onward delivery.

All communication must be held extremely confidential. I can get everything concluded within 24 to 48 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery. But it must be on the condition that you will give me 50% of the amount contained in the boxes and i must get assurance from you concerning my 50% before i will proceed.

I want us to transact this business and share the money, since the shipper have abandoned it and ran away.I will pay for the Non inspection fee and arrange for the boxes to be moved out of this Airport to your address, Once we are through i will deploy the services of a secured shipping Company geared to provide the security it needs to your doorstep. or i can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble. But i will share it 50% to you and 50% to me. But you have to assure me of my 50%. do respond to me through my direct email: james_brown45@rocketmail.com
You can call me at bellow telephone numbers.

Best Regards,
James Brown
