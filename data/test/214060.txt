 Quote:   Dear Sir/Madam,

My Respect to you with your family.My Name is Benjamin Kofi. The Branch Manager
of International Commercial Bank Ghana. I am looking for someone to trust who will
stand to receive some funds the sum of US$26,800,000.00 (Twenty Six Million Eight
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) deposited by Former Delta State Governor
in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, this funds was as a result of his loot,
financial embezzelment and misappropriation of State funds.The Government of his
country has confiscated and frozen all his accounts with other Banks, except this
one which I carefully placed on a SUSPENSE ACCOUNT of the Bank without a beneficiary.

He believed that all his account has been frozen by the Government, and the Ghana
Government prohibits him from entering Ghana.

I intend to part 30% of this fund to you while 70% shall be for me. I do need to
stress that there are practically no risk involved in this.

I need to know if you will be able to handle this with me before I explain to you
more details. If you are interested please send me your Full Names and Private Phone
Number for an Initial confidential communication. I wish for utmost confidentiality
in handling this transaction.
