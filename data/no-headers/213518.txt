I have decided to give alms to charity organizations. I cannot do this myself anymore because of my health. I once asked members of my family to give some money to charity organizations, they refused and kept the money.

I have a huge cash deposit of ( US$5,000.000.00 ) five Million dollars with a finance House abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations. You will take out 30% of these funds for your assistance and Effort.
