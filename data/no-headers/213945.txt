Dear Friend,
Longest time,i hope all is well together with you family,if so glory be to God almighty.
I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting my late father's money transferred under the cooperation of my new partner and husband Mr Alejandro Morientes from Paraguay. Presently i'm in Paraguay with my happy family and also for investment projects with my own share of the total sum.
Meanwhile,i didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how. Now contact Peter Kuma on his e-mail address below;

Name....Reverend Peter Kuma

Email address........reverendkuma@yahoo.co.uk

Telephone...........            00221 77 3054670      

Ask him to send you the total of $350.000.00(Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars) which i kept for your compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter. I appreciated your efforts at that time very much. so feel free and get in touched with the Reverend and instruct him where to send the amount to you.Please do let me know immediately you recieve it so that we can share the joy after all the
sufferness at that time.
At the moment,am very busy here because of the investment projects which me and my husband are having at hand. finally, remember that I had forwarded instruction to
the Reverend on your behalf to receive that money so feel free to get in touch with  the Reverend he will send the amount to you without any delay as i instructed him ok.
Best Regards.
