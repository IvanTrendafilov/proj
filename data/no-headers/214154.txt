PLEASE HELP ME OUT

Dear friend,
I am Madam Tracy Williams, and I have been suffering from Ovarian cancer deseed and the doctor says that I
have just two days to live. I am an Jordanian Woman. But base in Africa Burkina Faso for more than Ten years
now as a merchant in cocoa and cotton exportation. Now that I am about to end the race of life like this,
without any family members and no child.

I have $2.5 Million US DOLLARS. Two Million Five Houndred Thousand Us Dollars in Africa Development Bank(ADB)
Burkina Faso which I instructed the bank to give to Christ the King Missionary Home in Burkina Faso . But my
mind is not at rest as I am writing this letter now through the help of my computer beside my sick bed.
I also have ($4.5 Million US Dollars) Four Million Five Houndred Thousand Us Dollars at Ecobank here in Burkina
Faso and I have instructed the bank to transfer the money to the first foreigner that will apply to the bank
after I have gone so that bank should release the fund to him/her but you will assure me that you will take 50%
of the money and give 50% to the orphanage home in your country for my heart to rest. You are to contact the
bank through this email address: Email:ecobankinfopost_bf@bk.ru

Thanks
Yours fairly friend
Madam Tracy Williams.
