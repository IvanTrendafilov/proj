Attention: Sir/Madam.

I wish to notify you again that you were listed as a beneficiary to the total sum of US$15 million (Fifteen million United States Dollars ) in the intent of the deceased (name now withheld since this is my second letter to you).

I contacted you because you bear the surname identity and therefore I can present you as the beneficiary to the inheritance since there is no written will. My aim is to present you to my Bank Management as the Next of Kin to our deceased client. I will guide you all through the Claim procedure by providing all relevant Information and guiding you in your decisions and response to the Bank Management. All the papers will be processed after your acceptance.

In your acceptance of this deal, I request that you kindly forward to me your letter of acceptance; your current telephone and fax numbers, age, occupational status and a forwarding address to enable me submit to the Bank Management the details as the Next of Kin to the deceased Account owner.

Yours faithfully,
David Robinson A.
