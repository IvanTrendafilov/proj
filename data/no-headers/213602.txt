Dear Beloved Happy New Year,

Calvary greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ!! I am Mrs
Sharon Podlich , a widow of 67years old suffering from cancer of the
breast, My husband and my only son were killed last three years during
the UK terrorist Attack when we visited London for holidays.

My condition is serious and according to my doctor, he said it is
obvious that I may not survive. I have some funds that my late husband
WILLED to me in cash; the sum of $2m United States of American
Dollars. I packaged it in consignments and deposited it with a finance
house.

After my prayers, I searched site in the internet, I found your email
address and I decided to contact you for the usage of the funds in
your Ministry.

Therefore, child of God, if you are honest and faithful enough to use
this fund strictly for the work of God, your response will be highly
appreciated.

Yours in His Vineyard
Mrs Sharon Podlich.
