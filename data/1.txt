Now I have decided to invest this money in your country or anywhere safe for security and political reasons. I want you to help me retrieve this money for onward transfer to any designated bank account of your choice for investment purposes. 

We have to negotiate on what will be offered to you for assisting me to handle this project, I and my family have agreed to offer you 25% of the total sum and 5% will be used to cover all the expenses made both here and in your country while 70% is for my family .Please, read more on the news. www.savedarfur.org
