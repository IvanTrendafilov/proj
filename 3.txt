Dear Valued Partner, 

Please contact Reverend Ben Mark immediately or forward this email to him, asking him to send the ATM Visa Card valued at US$950,000.00 to you. Although my new partner is not happy that I have to allocate such amount to you bearing in mind your attitude toward the transaction at its crucial stage. 

Kindly be in contact with him via this address bellow; 
Rev. Ben MARK, 
E-mail: rev.markben@lavache.com 

Thanks and remain blessed. 

Yours Sincerely, 
Mrs. Suzanne T. Mubarak.
